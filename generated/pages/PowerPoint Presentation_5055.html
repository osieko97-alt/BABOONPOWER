2-1   INTRODUCTION
A number system defines how a number can be represented using distinct symbols. A number can be represented differently in different systems. For example, the two numbers (2A)16 and (52)8 both refer to the same quantity, (42)10, but their representations are different. 
	Several number systems have been used in the past and can be categorized into two groups: positional and non-positional systems. Our main goal is to discuss the positional number systems, but we also give examples of non-positional systems.

--- Slide 4 ---
2.4
2-2   POSITIONAL NUMBER SYSTEMS
In a positional number system, the position a symbol occupies in the number determines the value it represents. In this system, a number represented as:
has the value of:
in which S is the set of symbols, b is the base (or radix).

--- Slide 5 ---
2.5
S = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
The decimal system (base 10)
The word decimal is derived from the Latin root decem (ten). In this system the base b = 10 and we use ten symbols
The symbols in this system are often referred to as decimal digits or just digits. 

--- Slide 6 ---
2.6
Integers
Figure 2.1  Place values for an integer in the decimal system

--- Slide 7 ---
2.7
Example 2.1
The following shows the place values for the integer +224 in the decimal system.
Note that the digit 2 in position 1 has the value 20, but the same digit in position 2 has the value 200. Also note that we normally drop the plus sign, but it is implicit.

--- Slide 8 ---
2.8
Example 2.2
The following shows the place values for the decimal number −7508. We have used 1, 10, 100, and 1000 instead of powers of 10.
Note that the digit 2 in position 1 has the value 20, but the same digit in position 2 has the value 200. Also note that we normally drop the plus sign, but it is implicit.

--- Slide 9 ---
2.9
Reals
Example 2.3
The following shows the place values for the real number +24.13.

--- Slide 10 ---
2.10
The word binary is derived from the Latin root bini (or two by two). In this system the base b = 2 and we use only two symbols, 
The binary system (base 2)
S = {0, 1}
The symbols in this system are often referred to as binary digits or bits (binary digit). 

--- Slide 11 ---

Integers

--- Slide 12 ---
2.12
Example 2.4
The following shows that the number (11001)2 in binary is the same as 25 in decimal. The subscript 2 shows that the base is 2.
The equivalent decimal number is N = 16 + 8 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 25.

--- Slide 13 ---
2.13
Reals
Example 2.5
The following shows that the number (101.11)2 in binary is equal to the number 5.75 in decimal.

--- Slide 14 ---
2.14
The word hexadecimal is derived from the Greek root hex (six) and the Latin root decem (ten). In this system the base b = 16 and we use sixteen symbols to represent a number. The set of symbols is
The hexadecimal system (base 16)
S = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F} 
Note that the symbols A, B, C, D, E, F are equivalent to 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15 respectively. The symbols in this system are often referred to as hexadecimal digits.

--- Slide 16 ---
2.16
Example 2.6
The following shows that the number (2AE)16 in hexadecimal is equivalent to 686 in decimal.
The equivalent decimal number is N = 512 + 160 + 14 = 686.

--- Slide 17 ---
2.17
The word octal is derived from the Latin root octo (eight). In this system the base b = 8 and we use eight symbols to represent a number. The set of symbols is
The octal system (base 8)
S = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}

--- Slide 19 ---
2.19
Example 2.7
The following shows that the number (1256)8 in octal is the same as 686 in decimal.
Note that the decimal number is N = 512 + 128 + 40 + 6 = 686.

--- Slide 20 ---
2.20
Table 2.1 shows a summary of the four positional number systems discussed in this chapter.

--- Slide 21 ---
2.21
Table 2.2 shows how the number 0 to 15 is represented in different systems. 

--- Slide 22 ---
2.22
We need to know how to convert a number in one system to the equivalent number in another system. Since the decimal system is more familiar than the other systems, we first show how to covert from any base to decimal. Then we show how to convert from decimal to any base. Finally, we show how we can easily convert from binary to hexadecimal or octal and vice versa.
Conversion

--- Slide 24 ---
2.24
Example 2.8
The following shows how to convert the binary number (110.11)2 to decimal: (110.11)2 = 6.75.

--- Slide 25 ---
2.25
Example 2.9
The following shows how to convert the hexadecimal number (1A.23)16 to decimal.
Note that the result in the decimal notation is not exact, because 3 × 16−2 = 0.01171875. We have rounded this value to three digits (0.012). 

--- Slide 26 ---
2.26
Example 2.10
The following shows how to convert (23.17)8 to decimal.
This means that (23.17)8 ≈ 19.234 in decimal. Again, we have rounded up 7 × 8−2 = 0.109375.

2.29
Example 2.11
The following shows how to convert 35 in decimal to binary. We start with the number in decimal, we move to the left while continuously finding the quotients and the remainder of division by 2. The result is 35 = (100011)2.

--- Slide 30 ---
2.30
Example 2.12
The following shows how to convert 126 in decimal to its equivalent in the octal system. We move to the right while continuously finding the quotients and the remainder of division by 8. The result is 126 = (176)8.

--- Slide 31 ---
2.31
Example 2.13
The following shows how we convert 126 in decimal to its equivalent in the hexadecimal system. We move to the right while continuously finding the quotients and the remainder of division by 16. The result is 126 = (7E)16

2.34
Example 2.14
Convert the decimal number 0.625 to binary.
Since the number 0.625 = (0.101)2 has no integral part, the example shows how the fractional part is calculated. 

--- Slide 35 ---
2.35
Example 2.15
The following shows how to convert 0.634 to octal using a maximum of four digits. The result is 0.634 = (0.5044)8. Note that we multiple by 8 (base octal).

--- Slide 36 ---
2.36
Example 2.16
The following shows how to convert 178.6 in decimal to hexadecimal using only one digit to the right of the decimal point. The result is 178.6 = (B2.9)16 Note that we divide or multiple by 16 (base hexadecimal).

--- Slide 37 ---
2.37
Example 2.17
An alternative method for converting a small decimal integer (usually less than 256) to binary is to break the number as the sum of numbers that are equivalent to the binary place values shown:

--- Slide 38 ---
2.38
Example 2.18
A similar method can be used to convert a decimal fraction to binary when the denominator is a power of two:
The answer is then (0.011011)2

Binary-hexadecimal conversion

--- Slide 40 ---
2.40
Example 2.19
Show the hexadecimal equivalent of the binary number (110011100010)2.
Solution
We first arrange the binary number in 4-bit patterns:
100    1110     0010
Note that the leftmost pattern can have one to four bits. We then use the equivalent of each pattern shown in Table 2.2 on page 25 to change the number to hexadecimal: (4E2)16.

--- Slide 41 ---
2.41
Example 2.20
What is the binary equivalent of (24C)16?
Solution
Each hexadecimal digit is converted to 4-bit patterns:
2 → 0010, 4 → 0100, and C → 1100
The result is (001001001100)2.

--- Slide 42 ---
2.42
Binary-octal conversion
Figure 2.10  Binary to octal and octal to binary conversion

--- Slide 43 ---
2.43
Example 2.21
Show the octal equivalent of the binary number (101110010)2.
Solution
Each group of three bits is translated into one octal digit. The equivalent of each 3-bit group is shown in Table 2.2 on page 25. 
The result is (562)8.
101     110     010

--- Slide 44 ---
2.44
Example 2.22
What is the binary equivalent of for (24)8?
Solution
Write each octal digit as its equivalent bit pattern to get
2 → 010  and  4 → 100
The result is (010100)2.

Example 2.23
Find the minimum number of binary digits required to store decimal integers with a maximum of six digits.
Solution
k = 6, b1 = 10, and b2 = 2. Then
x = ék × (logb1 / logb2)ù = é6 × (1 / 0.30103)ù = 20. 
The largest six-digit decimal number is 999,999 and the largest 20-bit binary number is 1,048,575. Note that the largest number </pre>
