Soil and Agriculture
Part A
PowerPoint® Slides prepared by 
Jay Withgott and Kristy Manning

--- Slide 2 ---
This lecture will help you understand:
Soils and agriculture
A brief history of agriculture
Soil science fundamentals
Soil erosion and degradation
Soil conservation principles

--- Slide 3 ---
Central Case: No-Till Agriculture in Brazil
Southern Brazil’s farmers were suffering falling yields, erosion, and pollution from agrichemicals.
They turned to no-till farming, which bypasses plowing.
Erosion was reduced, soils were enhanced, and yields rose greatly. No-till methods are spreading worldwide.

--- Slide 4 ---
Agriculture today
We have converted 38% of Earth’s surface for agriculture, the practice of cultivating soil, producing crops, and raising livestock for human use and consumption.

Croplands (for growing plant crops) and rangelands (for grazing animal livestock) depend on healthy soil.

--- Slide 5 ---
World soil conditions
Soils are becoming degraded in many regions.

--- Slide 6 ---
Soil degradation by continent
Europe’s land is most degraded because of its long history of intensive agriculture.

But Asia’s and Africa’s soils are fast becoming degraded.

--- Slide 7 ---
Causes of soil degradation
Most soil degradation is caused by:
Livestock overgrazing
Deforestation
Cropland agriculture

--- Slide 8 ---
Prehistory of agriculture
People began shifting from hunting and gathering to agriculture about 10,000 years ago.

It probably began thus:
People brought back to camp the best wild fruits and seeds they could gather.
Some were dropped or disposed of nearby.
Plants grew near encampments.
Plants with favored qualities were selected and bred by proto-farmers (artificial selection).

--- Slide 9 ---
Origins of agriculture
Agriculture originated independently in several regions.

--- Slide 10 ---
Traditional agriculture
Agriculture by muscle power, animals, hand tools, simple machines

Subsistence agriculture = family produces only enough for itself

Intensive traditional agriculture = family uses animals, irrigation water, and fertilizer to produce enough to sell at market

--- Slide 11 ---
Industrialized agriculture
Modern intensive agriculture demands that vast fields be planted with single types of crops.

Monoculture is the uniform planting of a single crop.

--- Slide 12 ---
History of agriculture
Industrialized agriculture is displacing traditional farming, just as traditional farming displaced hunting and gathering.

--- Slide 13 ---
The green revolution
An intensification of industrialization of agriculture, which has produced large yield increases since 1950.


Increased yield per unit of land farmed.


Begun in U.S. and other developed nations; exported to developing nations like India and those in Africa.

--- Slide 14 ---
Soil as a system
Soil is a complex mixture of organic and inorganic components.

--- Slide 15 ---
Soil formation
Parent material: starting material affects composition of the resulting soil.

It can include bedrock, the solid rock that makes up the Earth’s crust.

Weathering: the processes that break down rocks and minerals, and the first step in soil formation.

Erosion: the movement of soil from one area to another. 	    	

--- Slide 16 ---
Three kinds of weathering
Physical or mechanical


Chemical


Biological

--- Slide 17 ---
Soil profile
Consists of layers called horizons

Simplest:
	A = topsoil
	B = subsoil
	C = parent material

But most have O, A, E, B, C, and R

--- Slide 18 ---
Soil profile
O Horizon: Organic or litter layer
A Horizon: Topsoil; mostly inorganic minerals with some organic material and humus mixed in; crucial for plant growth
E Horizon: Eluviation horizon; loss of minerals by leaching, a process whereby solid materials are dissolved and transported away
B Horizon: Subsoil; zone of accumulation or deposition of leached minerals and organic acids from above
C Horizon: Slightly altered parent material
R Horizon: Bedrock

--- Slide 19 ---
Soil characterization
Soil can be characterized by color and several other traits:
Texture
Structure
pH

--- Slide 20 ---
Soil texture
Determined by size of particles

Three main categories:

	Clay = particles &lt; 0.002 mm diameter

	Silt = particles 0.002–0.05 mm diameter

	Sand = particles 0.05–2.0 mm diameter

Best for plant growth is loam, an even mix of these three types.

--- Slide 21 ---
Soil texture

--- Slide 22 ---
Soil structure
Soil structure: a measure of the “clumpiness” of the soil

Soil pH: the degree of acidity or alkalinity, which influences a soil’s ability to support plant growth



--- Slide 23 ---
Regional soil differences and agriculture
Soil and soil profiles vary from place to place, with implications for agriculture.

Amazonian rainforest soil = lots of rain; leaches nutrients from topsoil out of reach of plant roots. Other nutrients taken up by lush vegetation, leaving little in soil.

Thus when farmed, soil gives out after a few years.

Kansas prairie soil = low rainfall keeps nutrients in topsoil, where plants take them up and recycle them back into soil when they die. Topsoil rich and productive.

--- Slide 24 ---
Swidden agriculture
In swidden agriculture, tropical forest is cut, the plot is farmed for 1-2 years, and the farmer moves on to clear another plot, leaving the first to regrow into forest.

--- Slide 25 ---
Erosion and deposition
Erosion = removal of material from one place and 	       its transport elsewhere
			by wind
			or water

Deposition = arrival of eroded material at a new location

These processes are natural, and can build up fertile soil.

But where artificially sped up, they are a big problem for farming.

--- Slide 26 ---
Erosion
Commonly caused by:
•  Overcultivating, too much plowing, poor planning
•  Overgrazing rangeland with livestock
•  Deforestation, especially on slopes

--- Slide 27 ---
Types of soil erosion

--- Slide 28 ---
Measuring soil erosion
Low-tech but effective method

Exposure of pin shows amount of erosion since it was placed in ground, level with surface.

--- Slide 29 ---
Soil erosion
Soil erosion is a global problem.
Coupled with rapid population growth, these two forces spell crisis for the future of agriculture.
Humans are the primary cause of erosion.
Humans are over 10 times more influential at moving soil than are all other natural processes combined.

--- Slide 30 ---
Desertification
A loss of more than 10% productivity due to:
Erosion
Soil compaction
Forest removal
Overgrazing
Drought
Salinization
Climate change
Depletion of water resources
etc.
When severe,  there is expansion of desert areas, or creation of new ones, e.g., the Middle East, formerly, “Fertile Crescent.”

--- Slide 31 ---
Soil degradation on drylands
Caused mostly by wind and water erosion

--- Slide 32 ---
The Dust Bowl
Drought and degraded farmland produced the 1930s Dust Bowl.

Storms brought dust from the U.S. Great Plains all the way to New York and Washington, and wrecked many lives.

--- Slide 33 ---
Soil conservation
As a result of the Dust Bowl,

		the U.S. Soil Conservation Act of 1935 and

		the Soil Conservation Service (SCS) were	created.


SCS:  local agents in conservation districts worked with farmers to disseminate scientific knowledge and help them conserve their soil.

--- Slide 34 ---
Soil conservation
Many nations followed the U.S. lead:
Today local soil conservation agents help farmers in many places in the world.
Brazil’s no-till effort is based on local associations.

--- Slide 35 ---
Preventing soil degradation
Several farming strategies to prevent soil degradation:
•  Crop rotation
•  Contour farming
•  Intercropping
•  Terracing
•  Shelterbelts
•  Conservation tillage

--- Slide 36 ---
Crop rotation
Alternating the crop planted (e.g., between corn and soybeans) can restore nutrients to soil and fight pests and disease.

--- Slide 37 ---
Contour farming
Planting along contour lines of slopes helps reduce erosion on hillsides.

--- Slide 38 ---
Intercropping
Mixing crops such as in strip cropping can provide nutrients and reduce erosion.

--- Slide 39 ---
Terracing
Cutting stairsteps or terraces is the only way to farm extremely steep hillsides without causing massive erosion. It is labor-intensive to create, but has been a mainstay for centuries in the Himalayas and the Andes.

--- Slide 40 ---
Shelterbelts
Rows of fast-growing trees around crop plantings provide windbreaks, reducing erosion by wind.

--- Slide 41 ---
Conservation tillage
No-till and reduced-tillage farming leaves old crop residue on the ground instead of plowing it into soil. This covers the soil, keeping it in place. 
Here, corn grows up out of a “cover crop.”

--- Slide 42 ---
Conservation tillage
Conservation tillage is not a panacea for all crops everywhere.

It often requires more chemical herbicides (because weeds are not plowed under).

It often requires more fertilizer (because other plants compete with crops for nutrients).
But legume cover crops can keep weeds at bay while nourishing soil, and green manures can be used as organic fertilizers. 

--- Slide 43 ---
Benefits of no-till in Brazil

--- Slide 44 ---
Irrigation
The artificial provision of water to support agriculture.


70% of all freshwater used by humans is used for irrigation.

Irrigated land globally covers more area than all of Mexico and Central America combined.

Irrigation has boosted productivity in many places… but too much can cause problems.

--- Slide 45 ---
Waterlogging and salinization
Overirrigation can raise the water table high enough to suffocate plant roots with waterlogging.



Salinization (buildup of salts in surface soil layers) is a more widespread problem.

Evaporation in arid areas draws water up through the soil, bringing salts with it. Irrigation causes repeated evaporation, bringing more salts up.
