TWO FARMERS - TRUE STORY
A true story of two farmers is helpful in illustrating certain 
characteristics of successful management.  These two farmers
were approximately the same age and they started farming
at about the same time.  Mr. Brown acquired in marriage a
good farm free of debt.  Mr. Johnson started with very little 
capital as a tenant.  At the end of his career, Mr. Brown had
lost his farm and was working for Mr. Johnson, who by that
time owned his own farm.  Mr. Brown had descended the 
agricultural ladder while Mr. Johnson was climbing up.

WHAT HAPPENED?

--- Slide 7 ---
Mr. Brown was serious and hard working.  He was an excellent 
employee.  He was superior to Mr. Johnson as a mechanic.  He
understood the feeding and care of livestock better than Mr. 
Johnson.  To the superficial observer he was a better farmer than
Mr. Johnson.  His machinery was in better repair.  His livestock
always looked good, sometimes almost too good.  Why, then, 
did he fail when Mr. Johnson succeeded?  The answer lies in
one of the most important concepts in being a successful farm
manager.  Mr. Johnson was more flexible.  Whereas Mr. Brown
kept the same enterprises throughout his career.  Mr. Johnson
adapted his operations to changing economic conditions.  When
crop prices were low, he selected cattle enterprises that utilized
cheap feed; he was quick to adopt new farming methods that 
held promise of reducing costs.
Successful farm management decisions must “pay off over the 
long haul”.
