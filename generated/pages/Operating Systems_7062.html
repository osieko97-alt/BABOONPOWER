Prof. B. I. KhodanpurHOD – Dept. of CSER. V. College of Engineering.EmailID:  bi.khodanpur@gmail.com
Subject: Operating Systems (For EDUSAT)
Common Paper for BA / B.Com / B.Sc
Code: CS-54

--- Slide 2 ---
Application Software (contd…):
   Spreadsheets:  The spreadsheet packages are designed to use numbers and formulas to do calculations with ease. Examples of spreadsheets include: 
Budgets 
Payrolls 
Grade Calculations 
Address Lists 
    The most commonly used spreadsheet programs are Microsoft Excel and Lotus 123. 

--- Slide 3 ---
Application Software(contd…):
   Graphic Presentations:  The presentation programs can be easier using overhead projectors. Other uses include:  
Slide Shows 
Repeating Computer Presentations on a computer monitor 
Using Sound and animation in slide shows  

   The most recognized graphic presentation programs are Microsoft PowerPoint and Harvard Graphics.  

--- Slide 4 ---
Application Software(contd…):
   Database Management System (DBMS):
A DBMS is a software tool that allows multiple users to store, access, and process data into useful information. 
Database programs are designed for these types of applications: 
Membership lists 
Student lists 
Grade reports 
Instructor schedules 
    All of these have to be maintained so you can find what you need quickly and accurately.  
     
Example:Microsoft Access, dBASE, Oracle.

What is Operating System?
What OS does?
Structure of OS
Evolution of OS
Batch Processing, Multiprogramming, Time sharing systems
Operating System Functions
Main Funtions of OS
Types of OS
Single User, Multi User systems

Operating Systems

--- Slide 7 ---
What is OS?
Operating System is a software, which makes a computer to actually work.

It is the software the enables all the programs we use.

The OS organizes and controls the hardware.

OS acts as an interface between the application programs and the machine hardware.

Examples: Windows, Linux, Unix and Mac OS, etc.,

	

--- Slide 8 ---
What OS does?
   An operating system performs basic tasks such as, 

controlling and allocating memory, 
prioritizing system requests, 
controlling input and output devices, 
facilitating networking and 
managing file systems. 


--- Slide 9 ---
Structure of Operating System:
Application Programs
System Programs
Software (Operating System)
HARDWARE
(Contd…)

--- Slide 10 ---
Structure of Operating System (Contd…):
The structure of OS consists of 4 layers:
Hardware
     Hardware consists of CPU, Main memory, I/O Devices, etc,

Software (Operating System)
    Software includes process management routines, memory management routines, I/O control routines, file management routines.

							(Contd…)

--- Slide 11 ---
Structure of Operating System (Contd…):

System programs
    This layer consists of compilers, Assemblers, linker etc.

Application programs
    This is dependent on users need. Ex. Railway reservation system, Bank database management etc.,


--- Slide 12 ---
Evolution of OS:
The evolution of operating systems went through seven major phases. 

Six of them significantly changed the ways in which users accessed computers through the open shop, batch processing, multiprogramming, timesharing, personal computing, and distributed systems.

In the seventh phase the foundations of concurrent programming were developed and demonstrated in model operating systems.

Evolution of OS (contd..):

--- Slide 15 ---
Batch Processing:
In Batch processing same type of jobs batch (BATCH- a set of jobs with similar needs) together and execute at a time.
The OS was simple, its major task was to transfer control from one job to the next.
The job was submitted to the computer operator in form of punch cards. At some later time the output appeared.
The OS was always resident in memory. (Ref. Fig. next slide)
Common Input devices were card readers and tape drives.

--- Slide 16 ---
Batch Processing (Contd…):
Common output devices were line printers, tape drives, and card punches.
Users did not interact directly with the computer systems, but he prepared a job (comprising of the program, the data, &amp; some control information).

OS
User program area

--- Slide 17 ---
Multiprogramming:
Multiprogramming is a technique to execute number of programs simultaneously by a single processor.
In Multiprogramming, number of processes reside in main memory at a time.
The OS picks and begins to executes one of the jobs in the main memory.
If any I/O wait happened in a process, then CPU switches from that job to another job.
Hence CPU in not idle at any time.

--- Slide 18 ---
Multiprogramming (Contd…):
 Figure dipicts the layout of multiprogramming system.
 The main memory consists of 5 jobs at a time, the CPU executes one by one.
Advantages:
Efficient memory utilization
Throughput increases
CPU is never idle, so performance increases.

--- Slide 19 ---
Time Sharing Systems:
Time sharing, or multitasking, is a logical extension of multiprogramming.
Multiple jobs are executed by switching the CPU between them.
In this, the CPU time is shared by different processes, so it is called as “Time sharing Systems”.
Time slice is defined by the OS, for sharing CPU time between processes.
Examples: Multics, Unix, etc.,

--- Slide 20 ---
Operating Systems functions:
The main functions of operating systems are:

Program creation
Program execution
Input/Output operations
Error detection
Resource allocation
Accounting
protection

--- Slide 21 ---
Types of OS:
Operating System can also be classified as,-

Single User Systems 

Multi User Systems

--- Slide 22 ---
Single User Systems: 
Provides a platform for only one user at a time. 

They are popularly associated with Desk Top operating system which run on standalone systems where no user accounts are required. 
Example: DOS

--- Slide 23 ---
Multi-User Systems: 
Provides regulated access for a number of users by maintaining a database of known users.

Refers to computer systems that support two or more simultaneous users. 

Another term for multi-user is time sharing.

Ex: All mainframes and  are multi-user systems.
Example: Unix
