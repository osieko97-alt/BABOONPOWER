What is foreordination?
Heavenly Father foreordained us in premortal life when he chose us to do a special work for him on earth. 
Being foreordained does not mean that we have to do the work; we still have our freedom or agency, but the opportunity is ours if we choose. 

--- Slide 3 ---
Before class one of you was chosen to do a service.
Please do it now.
Foreordination is like this.

The Story of John the Baptist

--- Slide 7 ---
Zacharias and his wife, Elisabeth, were Jews who lived near Jerusalem. They obeyed God’s commandments. 
For many years they prayed to have a baby. When they were old, they still had no children.


--- Slide 8 ---
Gabriel said that God would answer Zacharias and Elisabeth’s prayers.
Zacharias was a priest in the temple. One day an angel named Gabriel came to him. 
They would have a baby. 

--- Slide 9 ---
Gabriel said they should name the baby John.
Gabriel said that John would be a righteous prophet of God. He would teach people about Jesus Christ.

--- Slide 10 ---
Gabriel said that because he did not believe what God had promised, Zacharias would not be able to talk until John was born.

Zacharias did not believe the angel. 
Elisabeth was too old to have a baby. 

--- Slide 11 ---
Elisabeth’s son was born. Her friends and family were happy. 
They thought that the baby should have the same name as his father, Zacharias. 
But Elisabeth said that his name should be John. Everyone was surprised.


--- Slide 12 ---
The people asked Zacharias what the baby’s name should be. 
Zacharias still could not talk, so he wrote, “His name is John.”


--- Slide 13 ---
Then Zacharias was able to speak again. He was filled with the Holy Ghost. 
He told the people that Jesus Christ would soon be born and that John would prepare the people for Him.


--- Slide 14 ---
John grew up to become a great prophet. He taught people about Jesus Christ.

John lived in the desert for many years. 
He wore clothes made of camel’s hair and leather. 
He ate honey and locusts. 

--- Slide 16 ---
People came from the cities to hear him teach. He was known as John the Baptist.
John the Baptist taught the people about Jesus Christ. 

--- Slide 17 ---
John told them to repent of their sins and be baptized.
He baptized those who repented of their sins.

--- Slide 18 ---
The people asked John how to live better lives. He told them to share with the poor, tell the truth, and be fair to others. 
He said that Jesus Christ would soon come. 
Jesus would give them the gift of the Holy Ghost.

--- Slide 28 ---
President Ezra Taft Benson said:
“You are choice spirits, many of you having been held back in reserve for almost 6,000 years to come forth in this day, at this time, when the temptations, responsibilities, and opportunities are the very greatest” (in Conference Report, Oct. 1977, p. 43; or Ensign, Nov. 1977, p. 30).

Heavenly Father has also given us the opportunity to receive patriarchal blessings from a stake patriarch when we are old enough.
