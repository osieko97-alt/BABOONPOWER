What is an error in English? 
 
The concept of language errors is a fuzzy one. I&#x27;ll leave to linguists the technical definitions. 
Here we&#x27;re concerned only with deviations from the standard use of English as judged by 
sophisticated users such as professional writers, editors, teachers, and literate executives and 
personnel officers. The aim of this site is to help you avoid low grades, lost employment opportunities, lost business, and titters of amusement at the way you write or speak. 
 
But isn&#x27;t one person&#x27;s mistake another&#x27;s standard usage? 
 
Often enough, but if your standard usage caus es other people to consider you stupid or 
ignorant, you may want to consider changing it. You have the right to express yourself in any 
manner you please, but if you wish to communicate effectively you should use nonstandard 
English only when you intend to, rather than fall into it because you don&#x27;t know any better. 
 
I&#x27;m learning English as a second language. Will this site help me improve my English? 
 Very likely, though it&#x27;s really aimed at the most common errors of native speakers. The errors 
others make in English differ according to the characteristics of their first languages. Speakers 
of other languages tend to make some specific errors that are uncommon among native 
speakers, so you may also want to consult site s dealing specifically with English as a second 
language (see http://www.cln.org/subjects/esl_cur.html and 
http://esl.about.com/education/adulted/esl/). There is also a Help Desk for ESL students at 
Washington State University at http://www.wsu.edu/~gordonl/ESL/. An outstanding book you 
may want to order is Ann Raimes&#x27; Keys for Writ ers. This is not a question-and-answer site for 
ESL. 
 
Aren&#x27;t some of these points awfully picky?  
This is a relative matter. One person&#x27;s gaffe is another&#x27;s peccadillo. Some common 
complaints about usage strike me as too persnickety, but I&#x27;m just covering mistakes in 
English that happen to bother me. Feel free to create your own page listing your own pet 
peeves, but I welcome suggestions for additions to these pages.

What gives you the right to say what an error in English is? 
 
I could take the easy way out and say I&#x27;m a professor of English and do this sort of thing for a 
living. True, but my Ph.D. is in comparative literature, not composition or linguistics, and I 
teach courses in the history of ideas rather th an language as such. But I admire good writing 
and try to encourage it in my students. 
 
Why do you discuss mainly American usage? 
 
Because I&#x27;m an American, my students are mostly American, most English-speaking Web 
users are Americans, and American English is quickly becoming an international standard. I am slowly reworking the site to take note of American deviations from standard British 
practice. However, the job is complicated by the fact that Canadians, Australians, and many 
others often follow patterns somewhere between the two. If the standard usage where you 
are differs from what is described here, tell me  about it; and if I think it&#x27;s important to do so, 
I&#x27;ll note that fact. Meanwhile, just assume that this site is primarily about American English. 
 
Isn&#x27;t it oppressive of immigrants and subjugated  minorities to insist on the use of standard 
English? 
 
Language standards can certainly be used for oppressive purposes, but most speakers and 
writers of all races and classes want to use language in a way that will impress others. The fact is that the world is full of teachers, employers, and other authorities who may penalize 
you for your nonstandard use of the English language. Feel free to denounce these people if 
you wish; but if you need their good opinion to get ahead, you&#x27;d be wise to learn standard 
English. Note that I often suggest differing us ages as appropriate depending on the setting: 
spoken vs. written, informal vs. formal; slang is often highly appropriate. In fact, most of the 
errors discussed on this site are common in th e writing of privileged middle-class Americans, 
and some are characteristic of people with advanced degrees and considerable intellectual 
attainments. However you come down on this issue, note that the great advantage of an 
open Web-based educational site like this is that it&#x27;s voluntary: take what you want and 
leave the rest. It&#x27;s interesting that I have re ceived hundreds of messages from non-native 
speakers thanking me for these pages and none from such people complaining that my page 
discriminate against them. 
 
But you made a mistake yourself! 
 
We all do, from time to time. Drop me a line if you think you&#x27;ve found an error in my own 
writing. If I think you&#x27;re right, I&#x27;ll correct it; but be prepared to be disagreed with. If you write 
me, please don&#x27;t call me &quot;Brian.&quot; My given name is Paul.

Common Errors 
 
360 DEGREES/180 DEGREES 
 
When you turn 360 degrees you&#x27;ve completed a circle and are back where you started. So if 
you want to describe a position that&#x27;s diametrically opposed to another, the expression you 
want is not &quot;360 degrees aw ay&quot; but &quot;180 degrees away.&quot;  
 
A/AN 
 
If the word following begins with a vowel, the word you want is &quot;an&quot;: &quot;Have an apple, 
Adam.&quot; If the word following begins with a consonant, but begins with a vowel sound, you 
still need &quot;an&quot;: &quot;An X-ray will show whether there&#x27;s a worm in it.&quot; It is nonstandard and often 
considered sloppy speech to utter an &quot;uh&quot; sound in such cases. 
 
When the following word definitely begins with a consonant sound, you need &quot;a&quot;: &quot;A snake 
told me apples enhance mental abilities.&quot; 
 See also &quot;an historic.&quot;  
 
A.D. 
 
&quot;A.D.&quot; does not mean &quot;after death,&quot; as many people suppose. &quot;B.C.&quot; stands for the English phrase &quot;before Christ,&quot; but &quot;A.D.&quot; stands conf usingly for a Latin phrase: anno domini (&quot;in the 
year of the Lord&quot;--the year Jesus was born). If the calendar actually changed with Jesus&#x27; death, 
then what would we do with the years during which he lived? Since Jesus was probably 
actually born around 6 B.C. or so, the connection of the calendar with him can be 
misleading. 
 
Many Biblical scholars and historians, and archeologists prefer the less sectarian 
designations &quot;before the Common Era&quot; (B.C.E.) and &quot;the Common Era&quot; (C.E.).

 All of these abbreviations can also be spelled without their periods. 
 
AM/PM 
 
&quot;AM&quot; stands for the Latin phrase &quot;Ante Me ridiem&quot;--which means &quot;before noon&quot;--and &quot;PM&quot; 
stands for &quot;Post Meridiem&quot;: &quot;after noon.&quot; Alth ough digital clocks routinely label noon &quot;12:00 
PM&quot; you should avoid this expression not only because it is incorrect, but because many 
people will imagine you are talking about midnight instead. The same goes for &quot;12:00 AM.&quot; 
Just say or write &quot;noon&quot; or &quot;midnight&quot; when you mean those precise times. 
 
It is now rare to see periods placed after these abbreviations: &quot;A.M.&quot;, but in formal writing it 
is still preferable to capitalize them, though the lower-case &quot;am&quot; and &quot;pm&quot; are now so 
popular they are not likely to get you into trouble. 
 
Occasionally computer programs encourage you to write &quot;AM&quot; and &quot;PM&quot; without a space 
before them, but others will misread your data if you omit the space. The nonstandard 
pattern of omitting the space is spreading rapidly, and should be avoided in formal writing. 
 
ABJECT 
 
&quot;Abject&quot; is always negative, meaning &quot;lowly&quot; or  &quot;hopeless.&quot; You can&#x27;t experience &quot;abject joy&quot; 
unless you&#x27;re being deliberately paradoxical. 
 
ABLE TO 
 
People are able to do things, but things are not able to be done: you should not say, &quot;the 
budget shortfall was able to be  solved by selling brownies.&quot; 
 
ABOUT 
 
&quot;This isn&#x27;t about you.&quot; What a great rebuke! But c onservatives sniff at this sort of abstract use 
of &quot;about,&quot; as in &quot;I&#x27;m all about good taste&quot; or &quot;successful truffle-making is about temperature 
control&quot;; so it&#x27;s better to avoid it in very formal English. 
 
ABSORBTION/ABSORPTION 
 
Although it&#x27;s &quot;absorbed&quot; and &quot;absorbing&quot; the co rrect spelling of the noun is &quot;absorption.&quot; 
 
ABSTRUSE/OBTUSE 
 
Most people first encounter &quot;obtuse&quot; in geometry  class, where it labels an angle of more than 
90 degrees. Imagine what sort of blunt arrowhead that kind of angle would make and you 
will understand why it also has a figurative meaning of &quot;dull, stupid.&quot; But people often mix 
the word up with &quot;abstruse,&quot; which means &quot;difficult to understand.&quot; 
 

 5 
 When you mean to criticize something for being needlessly complex or baffling, the word 
you need is not &quot;obtuse,&quot; but &quot;abstruse.&quot; 
 
ACCEDE/EXCEED 
 
If you drive too fast, you exceed the speed limit. &quot;Accede&quot; is a much rarer word meaning &quot;give in,&quot; &quot;agree.&quot; 
 
ACCENT MARKS 
 
In what follows, &quot;accent mark&quot; will be used in a loose sense to include all diacritical marks
