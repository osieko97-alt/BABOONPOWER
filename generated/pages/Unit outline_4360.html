Descr iption:  
This unit is based on recent and significant insights from cognitive and developmental psychology to provide 
frames of reference to assist pre -service teachers to understand student characteristics in the middle and 
adolescent years, and their implications for teaching. Particular emphasis is placed on relevant aspects of the 
learner, the teaching context and how to connect educational theory to practice in learning environments. Pre -
service students are expected to reflect on theories of learni ng, develop an informed personal view of learning 
processes, and have a critical reflective understanding of pedagogy based on sound educational psychology 
principles. From their individual and social perspectives students will examine and compare the proc esses of how 
people learn and develop a rich understanding of the teacher’s role in creating effective, challenging and inclusive 
learning environments. An important aim of the unit is to enable pre -service teachers to implement effective 
practices to faci litate learning in in today’s digitally enabled classrooms.

Page 2 of 21 Version:   Mode/ attendance pattern :  
This is a fully online unit.  
The Faculty of Education and Arts is committed to preparing graduates who are workforce ready. 
Readiness for the practical demands of classroom teaching involves the capacity to apply 
theoretical knowledge. The ability to apply knowledg e is reflected in the Australian Qualifications 
Framework requirements at Graduate level (http://www.aqf.edu.au/aqf/in -detail/aqf -levels/).  
This unit is an important part of your development as a teacher. Thus full engagement in this unit is 
strongly advis ed.

Page 3 of 21 Version:   LEARNING OUTCOMES  
This unit contributes to a profession al program that requires development of particular attributes that 
were established during the program’s internal approval and external accreditation  processes .  
On successful completion of this unit, you should  be able to:  
1. develop and apply a critical understanding of student characteristics and learning needs, using 
human development and learning theories, with a particular focus on adolescence and the 
secondary school years (GA4, GA5; APST 1.1, 1.2)  
2. critically analyse basic assumptions, concepts, and principles of major learning and human 
development theories to determine the implications of each theory for  instructional settings 
(GA4, GA5, GA8; APST 1.1, 1.2, 1.5)  
3. articulate a critical understanding of the impact of culture, cultural identity and linguistic 
background on the education of students from diverse linguistic, cultural, religious and 
socioeconomi c backgrounds, including students from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander 
backgrounds (GA4, GA8; APST 1.3, 1.4)  
4. critically examine and synthesise individual and social constructivist approaches to learning 
and teaching, to inform the development of stra tegies that are responsive to the needs of 
diverse learners (GA8; APST 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5)  
5. synthesise theories of learning and examples and apply to the evaluation, development and 
safe, responsible, ethical implementation of ICT enabled learning reso urces and pedagogies 
to engage diverse learners (GA8, GA9, GA10; APST 3.4, 4.1, 4.5) . 
 
AUSTRALIAN PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS FOR TEACHERS  
The Professional Standards are a public statement that describes the professional knowledge, 
professional practice and pro fessional engagement required of teachers. The Standards also 
underpin registration decisions at different career junctures. For teacher registration purposes , the 
‘Graduate’ Standards are the benchmark for those completing initial teacher education progra ms 
and applying for provisional registration. You can view the complete set of standards here: 
http://www.aitsl.edu.au/australian -professional -standards -for-teachers  
On successful completion of this unit, you should have developed your ability to:  
1.1 Demonstrate knowledge and understanding of physical, social and intellectual development 
and characteristics of students and how these may affect learning.  
1.2 Demonstrate knowl edge and understanding of research into how students learn and the 
implications for teaching.  
1.3 Demonstrate knowledge of teaching strategies that are responsive to the learning strengths 
and needs of students from diverse linguistic, cultural, religious and socioeconomic 
backgrounds.  
1.4  Demonstrate broad knowledge and understanding of the impact of culture, cultural identity and 
linguistic background on the education of students from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander 
backgrounds.  
1.5 Demonstrate kno wledge and understanding of strategies for differentiating teaching to meet 
the specific learning needs of students across the full range of abilities.  
3.4 Demonstrate knowledge of a range of resources, including ICT, that engage students in their 
learning .

activities . 
 
GRADUATE ATTRIBUTES  
Each unit in your program contributes in some way to the development of the ACU Graduate 
Attributes which you should demonstrate by the time you complete your course . You can view the 
ACU Graduate Attributes for all courses at http://www.acu.edu.au/204356 . All Australian universities 
have their expected graduate attributes – ACU’s Graduate Attributes have a greater emphasis on 
ethical behaviour and community responsibility than those of many other universities . All of your 
units will enable you to develop Graduate A ttributes . 
On successful completion of this unit, you should have developed your ability to :  
GA4 think critically and reflectively  
GA5 demonstrate values, knowledge, skills and attitudes appropriate to the 
discipline and/or profession  
GA8 locate, organise, analyse, synthesise and evaluate information  
GA9 demonstrate  effective communication in oral and written English language and 
visual media  
GA10  utilise information and communication and other relevant technologies.

from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander backgrounds  
Learning theories and applications for teaching and learning of self -regulation and lifelong 
learning  
 behavioural and social cognitive theories and how they apply to classroom management  
 information -processing theory, memory and learning strate gies 
 constructivist approaches to learning, teaching and assessment

QUALITY ASSURANCE AND STUDENT FEEDBACK  
This unit has been evaluated through the ‘Student Evaluation of Learning and Teaching’ (SELT) 
online surveys.  
For Semester 1, 2018, the order of the 2nd and 3rd assessment tasks have been reversed. This 
allows more time to engage with relevant content via the online modules before the submission of 
the tasks.  
SELT surveys are usua lly conducted at the end of the teaching period.</pre>
