Review and finish Sabbath questions

On the sabbath:
Jesus healed a lame man (John 5)
Disciples pluck grain (Mark 2, Matt 12, Luke 6)
Jesus healed a man with a withered hand healed (Mark 3:1-6, Matt 12:9-14, Luke 6:6-11)

Review and finish Sabbath questions
These three examples provide divine commentary on the law of the sabbath from the Lord of the Sabbath:
The law allowed this man to carry his bed on the sabbath (John 5:8)
The law allowed the priests to do on the sabbath what others could not (Matt 12:5, kindle no fire Ex 35:3, blameless as instructed Num 28:2,8)
The law allowed one to pluck and eat on the sabbath as did the disciples (Matt 12:7)
The law allowed an animal to be lifted out of a pit on the sabbath (Matt 12:11)
The law allowed doing well on the sabbath, and healing on the sabbath (Matt 12:12)
Side note:  Similarly, we have the leverage of Jesus’ commentary  on marriage and divorce in Mark 10:3-5 and Matt 5:31-32 to better understand Deut 24:1-4 (Moses law on marriage and divorce).

Review and finish Sabbath questions

Observations in regard to these three incidents on the sabbath:
Wrong is always wrong (I Jn 3:4, Rom 6:23).  Don’t unnecessarily infer that Jesus ever morphed wrong into right, or that we can either.
We may need to grow in our understanding of what is right and wrong (Heb 5:14) just as did the Jews in Matt 12:7.
Jesus never broke God’s law (I Peter 2:22)
And Jesus instructed others to do keep God’s law (Mark 2:28, Mark 1:44)

Jesus Teaches and Heals by the SeaMark 3:7-12; Matt 12:15-21
Matt 12
15  But when Jesus knew it, he withdrew himself from thence: and great multitudes followed him, and he healed them all;  16  And charged them that they should not make him known:  17  That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying,  18  Behold my servant, whom I have chosen; my beloved, in whom my soul is well pleased: I will put my spirit upon him, and he shall shew judgment to the Gentiles.  19  He shall not strive, nor cry; neither shall any man hear his voice in the streets.  20  A bruised reed shall he not break, and smoking flax shall he not quench, till he send forth judgment unto victory.  21  And in his name shall the Gentiles trust.
Mark 3
7  But Jesus withdrew himself with his disciples to the sea: and a great multitude from Galilee followed him, and from Judaea,  8  And from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea, and from beyond Jordan; and they about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, when they had heard what great things he did, came unto him.  9  And he spake to his disciples, that a small ship should wait on him because of the multitude, lest they should throng him.  10  For he had healed many; insomuch that they pressed upon him for to touch him, as many as had plagues.  11  And unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him, and cried, saying, Thou art the Son of God.  12  And he straitly charged them that they should not make him known.

Spiritual Gifts and Evil Spirits
Jesus healed the multitudes and cast out demons.  He in turn gave his apostles the power to heal and cast out demons.
One may question whether spiritual gifts and demon possession still exist today.
We meet denominationalists who believe in spiritual gifts today.

--- Slide 14 ---
Spiritual Gifts and Evil Spirits
Spiritual gifts at the hands of man (healing, prophecy, tongues, etc.) and demon possession ended at the time period of Christ’s first coming, in the first century era.
I Cor 13:8-13 foretells a time at which “tongues… shall cease” – but for time’s sake we will not analyze this passage today
Zechariah 13 pinpoints the time at which spiritual gifts would cease.  Even a child can understand the timeframe for the end of these gifts.

Spiritual Gifts and Evil Spirits
Zech 13:2 prophesied that there would be a “day” in which God would cause the “prophets and the unclean spirit to pass out of the land.”  
Was the“day” (e.g. time period, see John 8:56) in which prophets and demons would pass from the land the time of Jesus’ second coming as some believe?

--- Slide 16 ---
Spiritual Gifts and Evil Spirits
The “day” of Zechariah was the timeframe of Jesus’ first coming:
Zech 12:9-10  “in that day… they shall look upon me whom they have pierced”  (John 19:37)
Zech 13:1 “in that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem for sin and for uncleanness” (Acts 2, illustration - song “there is a fountain filled with blood”)
Zech 13:4-7 “in that day… what are these wounds in thine hands… smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered”  (Matt 26:31)

Spiritual Gifts and Evil Spirits
The “day” of Zechariah was the timeframe of Jesus’ first coming:
Zech 13:2-3 “in that day… also I will cause the prophets and the unclean spirit to pass out of the land.  And it shall come to pass, that when any shall yet prophesy, then his father and his mother that begat him shall say unto him, thou shalt not live; for thou speakest lies in the name of the Lord…”

The “day” in which prophets (miraculous spiritual gifts) and demons would pass away would be during the time period in which the “shepherd was smitten” (Jesus’ death) not at the chief shepherd’s second coming.  Demons  and spiritual gifts passed from this earth almost 2000 years ago.

Jesus Selects Twelve ApostlesMark 3:13-19; Luke 6:12-16; (Matt 10:2-4)

13 ¶  And he goeth up into a mountain, and calleth unto him whom he would: and they came unto him.  14  And he ordained twelve, that they should be with him, and that he might send them forth to preach,  15  And to have power to heal sicknesses, and to cast out devils:  16  And Simon he surnamed Peter;  17  And James the son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James; and he surnamed them Boanerges, which is, The sons of thunder:  18  And Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Canaanite,  19  And Judas Iscariot, which also betrayed him: and they went into an house.

The Sermon on the Mount –Character of Kingdom Citizens
Jesus came preaching the gospel, preaching the kingdom of God (Matt 4:23, Mark 1:14-15).
Jesus was preparing people for a change of law (Matt 5:17-18) and described to them the kind of righteousness expected of kingdom citizens. 
The true righteousness that Jesus describes in his sermon is the righteousness that we, kingdom citizens today should have.
The righteousness described in this sermon touches every part of our lives.

The Sermon on the Mount -Preparatory Teaching
In preaching the gospel of the kingdom and preparing his listener for the kingdom, Jesus described doctrines that would later be kingdom law / NT law (the OT was in force until the NT was ratified by his blood, after his death – Heb 8:17)
John 3:5 “Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.” NT requirement for salvation
Luke 22:19 “And he took bread, and gave thanks, and brake it, and gave unto them, saying, This is my body which is given for you: this do in remembrance of me.” NT practice
Matt 18:17 “And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church: but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican.”  The church did not even exist.

Example:  Matt 5:32 is NT law on marriage and divorce, not OT law.

The Sermon on the Mount –Character of Kingdom Citizens
Jesus describes in Matt 5:
The “beatitudes” are characteristics one should have to be blessed in their deed (James 1:25, Matt 5:3-12).  Those who have these traits are “well-off” before</pre>
