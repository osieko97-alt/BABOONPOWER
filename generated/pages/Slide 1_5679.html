What does it mean?

--- Slide 6 ---
Peer pressure is the influence you and your friends have on one another. 
How can peer pressure be negative or positive? 

--- Slide 7 ---
In this lesson we will learn about a king who was influenced by negative peer pressure and the consequences he suffered as a result of his decisions. 

--- Slide 8 ---
Rehoboam

--- Slide 9 ---
Solomon was the king of Israel for a long time. He obeyed God for many years. 
Solomon had many wives. Some of his wives did not believe in God. They worshiped idols. 


--- Slide 10 ---
When Solomon was old, his wives wanted him to worship their idols. He forgot God.
Solomon did the wrong thing. He made sacrifices to the idols. God was angry at him.

--- Slide 11 ---
God said Solomon’s kingdom would be divided after he died. 
When Solomon died he was buried near his father, David.

--- Slide 12 ---
After Solomon died, his son Rehoboam became king.
He was not a good king. He was mean to the people. 

--- Slide 13 ---
He ignored the counsel of his older advisors. They had been advisors to his father, Solomon.
The older advisors told Rehoboam the people were not happy because his father had made them pay very high taxes.

--- Slide 14 ---
Rehoboam listened to the advice of young men he had grown up with instead. 
He told the people he would make their taxes even higher.

--- Slide 15 ---
Ten of the twelve tribes of Israel revolted against Rehoboam. 
They left the land of Judah and went to the lands in the north. A rebel leader named Jeroboam became their king.

--- Slide 16 ---
The south part of the land was called the Kingdom of Judah. Two Israelite tribes lived there. They were called Jews. 
The north part of the land was called the Kingdom of Israel. The ten Israelite tribes lived there. 

--- Slide 17 ---
Jeroboam was strong and brave, but he was not a good king. 
Jeroboam made golden idols and burned sacrifices to them. He told the people to worship the idols. 

--- Slide 18 ---
A prophet of God told Jeroboam to repent. But Jeroboam would not repent. 
Jeroboam and Rehoboam had armies. They fought each other for many years. 

--- Slide 19 ---
Jeroboam and Rehoboam were wicked kings. They did not teach the people to obey God. 
The Israelites became wicked like their kings. 

--- Slide 20 ---
Who was Rehoboam’s father? 
Let’s read 1 Kings 11:43
After Solomon died and Rehoboam became king, what did the people want him to do for them? 
Let’s read 1 Kings 12:3–4

--- Slide 21 ---
Whom did Rehoboam first consult with? 
Let’s read 1 Kings 12:6
What was their advice to Rehoboam? 
Let’s read 1 Kings 12:7

--- Slide 22 ---
Why do you think this was good advice? 
What could we learn from this advice about how we should treat our families, friends, and neighbors? 

--- Slide 23 ---
Whom did Rehoboam consult with next? 
Let’s read 1 Kings 12:8–9

Let’s read 1 Kings 12:10–11

--- Slide 24 ---
The reference to scorpions in verse 11 alludes to whips made of several thongs of leather with metal barbs embedded in the ends.

--- Slide 25 ---
How did Rehoboam respond when the people came to him to get his answer? 
Let’s read 1 Kings 12:13–14

--- Slide 26 ---
Why do you think Rehoboam decided to follow the advice of the younger men rather than the older men? 
How do you think the people felt about Rehoboam’s decision? 

--- Slide 27 ---
What are some of the consequences of being unkind to others?
What was the result of Rehoboam following the advice of his young friends instead of the wiser old men? 
Let’s read 1 Kings 12:19–21
Because Rehoboam followed unwise advice, only the tribes of Judah and Benjamin accepted him as their king. 

--- Slide 28 ---
Jeroboam led a revolt against Rehoboam and became king of the other ten tribes. 
This is how the twelve tribes of Israel became divided into two kingdoms, the kingdom of Judah (Rehoboam) and the kingdom of Israel (Jeroboam). 
Note: Although the names Rehoboam and Jeroboam are similar, the two men were not brothers nor related.

--- Slide 29 ---

In the Northern Hemisphere (north of the equator) there is a star called the North Star. 
Enrichment Activity #2
It has been a guide to sailors, campers, and explorers throughout the ages. The direction north can always be located by means of this star. 

--- Slide 44 ---
The North Star can be found by finding the Big Dipper, a group of seven stars shaped like a pan with a handle. 
Enrichment Activity #2
If a line is drawn through the two pointer stars of the Big Dipper, the two farthest stars from the handle, the line points to the North Star. The North Star is also the last star in the handle of the Little Dipper.  

--- Slide 45 ---
This story is about when President Gordon B. Hinckley relied on the North Star for comfort and consistency.  
Enrichment Activity #2
“After a day of good, hard labor, my younger brother Sherm and I would sleep out under the stars in the box of an old farm wagon… 

--- Slide 46 ---

“Each night, like many generations of boys before us, we would trace the Big Dipper, down the handle and out past the cup, to find the North Star…

--- Slide 48 ---
Enrichment Activity #2
“Because of those boyhood musings, the polar star came to mean something to me. I recognized it as a constant in the midst of change. 
“It was something that could always be counted on, something that was dependable, an anchor in what otherwise appeared to me a moving and unstable firmament” (in Jeffrey R. Holland, “President Gordon B. Hinckley,” Ensign, June 1995, p. 5). 

--- Slide 49 ---
How can we be constant like the North Star?
If we decide now that when we face temptations or peer pressure we will choose the right, we will be constant in making righteous decisions and others will look to us for direction. 
Our decisions will not be affected by fear of what people will think of us or by negative pressure from others.
