<pre>ATOMIC STRUCTURE AND THE 
PERIODIC TABLE 
 
Preface   
The structure of the atom is extensively covered here.  The periodic table is the 
arrangement of atoms of elements based on their atomic structu re. Emphasis on 
the trends across and down the periodic table of atoms  is important for the 
teacher facilitator. This work should be covered before “Chemical bonding 
and structure ”. The two complements each other in understanding periodicity .

A.ATOMIC STRUCTURE 
 
The atom is the smallest particle of an element that take part in a chemical 
reaction.The atom is made up of three subatomic particle: 
 (i)Protons 
 (ii)Electrons 
 (iii)Neutrons 
 
(i)Protons 
1.The proton is positively charged 
2.Is found in the centre of an atom called nucleus 
3.It has a relative  mass 1 
4.The number of protons in a atom of an element is its Atomic number 
 
 (ii)Electrons  
1.The Electrons is negatively charged 
2.Is found in fixed regions surrounding the centre of an atom called energy 
levels/orbitals. 
3.It has a relative  mass 1/1840 
4.The number of protons and electrons  in a atom of an e lement is always equal 
 
(iii)Neutrons 
1.The Neutron is neither positively or negatively charge d thus neutral. 
2.Like protons it is found in the centre of an atom cal led nucleus  
3.It has a relative  mass 1 
4.The number of protons and neutrons in a atom of an e lement is its Mass 
number

Most atoms of elements exist as isotopes.  
Isotopes are atoms of the same  element , having the same number of 
protons /atomic number but different  number of neutrons /mass number.  
By convention, isotopes are written with the mass number as superscript and the 
atomic number as subscript to the left of the chemical sy mbol of the element. 
i.e. 
   mass number             
   atomic  number        m n  X            symbol of element 
 
Below is the conventional method of writing the 1st twenty elements showing 
the mass numbers and atomic numbers;

The mass of an average atom is very small (10-22 g).Masses of atoms are 
therefore expressed in relation to a chosen element. 
 The atom recommended is 12C isotope whose mass is arbitrarily assigned as 
12.000 atomic mass units(a.m.u) . 
All other atoms are compared to the mass of 12C isotope to give the relative at  
The relative atomic mass(RAM) is therefore defined as “the mass of average 
atom of an element  compared to  1/12  an atom of 12C isotope whose mass is 
arbitrarily fixed as 12.000 atomic mass units(a.m.u)  ” i.e; 
   
RAM   =  mass of  atom of an element 
   1/12  of one atom of 12C isotope 
 
Accurate relative atomic masses (RAM) are got from the mass spectrometer. 
Mass spectrometer determines the  isotopes of the element and their relative  
abundance/availability. 
 Using the relative abundances/availability of the isot opes, the relative atomic 
mass (RAM) can be determined /calculated as in the below exa mples. 
a) Chlorine occurs as 75% 35
17Cl and 25% 37
17Cl isotopes. Calculate the 
relative atomic mass of Chlorine. 
 
Working 
 100 atoms of chlorine contains 75 atoms of 35
17Cl isotopes 
 100 atoms of chlorine contains 75 atoms of 37
17Cl isotopes 
 Therefore; 
 RAM  of chlorine = ( 75/100 x 35)   +  25/100  x 37 =  35.5  
 Note that: 
Relative atomic mass has no units 
More atoms of chlorine exist as 35
17Cl(75%) than as 37
17Cl(25%)     
therefore RAM is nearer to the more abundant isotope. 
 
b) Calculate the relative atomic mass of potassium given that it  exist as; 

5 
 
93.1%  39
19K ,  0.01%  40
19K  ,  6.89%  41
19K , 
 
Working 
 100 atoms of potassium contains 93.1 atoms of 39
19K isotopes 
 100 atoms of potassium contains 0.01 atoms of 40
19K isotopes 
 100 atoms of potassium contains 6.89 atoms of 41
19K isotopes 
 Therefore; 
 RAM  of potassium = (93.1/100 x39) + (0.01/100 x 40) +(6.89 /100 x 39) 
       =   
 Note that: 
Relative atomic mass has no units 
More atoms of potassium exist as 39
19K (93.1%) therefore RAM is 
nearer to the more abundant 39
19K  isotope. 
 
c) Calculate the relative atomic mass of  Neon given that it e xist as; 
90.92%  20
10Ne ,  0.26%  21
10Ne  ,  8.82%  22
10Ne, 
 
Working 
 100 atoms of Neon contains 90.92 atoms of 20
10Ne  isotopes 
 100 atoms of Neon contains 0.26 atoms of 21
10Ne  isotopes 
 100 atoms of Neon contains 8.82 atoms of 22
10 Ne  isotopes
 Therefore; 
 RAM  of  Neon = (90.92/100 x20) + (0.26/100 x 21) +(8.82 /100 x 22) 
       =   
 Note that: 
Relative atomic mass has no units 
More atoms of Neon exist as 20
10Ne (90.92 %) therefore RAM is 
nearer to the more abundant 20
10Ne  isotope. 
 
d) Calculate the relative atomic mass of  Argon given that it ex ist as; 
90.92%  20
10Ne ,  0.26%  21
10Ne  ,  8.82%  22
10Ne, 
NB 
The relative atomic mass is a measure of the masses of atoms . The higher the 
relative atomic mass, the heavier the atom. 
 
Electrons are found in energy levels/orbital. 
An energy level is a fixed region around/surrounding the nucleus of an atom 
occupied by electrons of the same (potential) energy.  
By convention  energy levels are named 1,2,3…  outwards  from the region 
nearest to nucleus. 
 
Each energy level is occupied by a fixed number of electro ns: 
 The 1st energy level is occupied by a maximum of two electrons 

6 
 
 The 2nd  energy level is occupied by a maximum of eight  electrons 
The  3rd  energy level is occupied by a maximum of eight  electrons( or   
eighteen electrons if available)  
The  4th   energy level is occupied by a maximum of eight  electrons( or 
eighteen or thirty two electrons if available) 
 
This arrangement of electrons in an atom is called electron configuration  / 
structure . 
By convention the electron configuration / structure of an atom of an ele ment 
can be shown in form of a diagram using either cross( x) or dot( ●) to
