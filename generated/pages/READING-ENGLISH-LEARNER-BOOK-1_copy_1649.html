Learner Book

iiAcknowledgements 
These learner books were developed as a result of the generous financial 
support from DFID and USAID/Kenya. The Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Education, Professor George Godia, was instrumental in directing the tireless technical efforts of the Ministry of Education, the Kenya National Examinations Council, Kenya Education Staff Institute, Kenya Institute of Special Education and the Teachers’ Service Commission. Together, DFID and USAID submit these lesson plans to the Ministry of Education for research purposes in Primary Math and Reading (PRIMR) Initiative-supported schools. 
This book is for research and evaluation 
purposes only and no usage of these lesson plans is permitted outside of 
PRIMR-supported schools.
Special thanks go to the technical team who wrote the lesson plans based 
on the scope and sequence created in conjunction with the Ministry of Education. Thanks to Dr. Sylvia Linan-Thompson for leading the creation of the Kiswahili and English scope and sequences as well as the initial insights into the lesson plan framework. Thank you also to our technical support team, which includes Dr. Agatha van Ginkel, Dr. Hellen Inyega, Prof. Angelina Kioko and Jody Roy. Congratulations and appreciation to the RTI PRIMR technical team, namely Dr. Benjamin Piper, Titus Kazungu, Sarah Koko, Isaac Cherotich, Samuel Ogwang, Salome Ong’ele and Jessica Mejia for all of their hard work writing the Teachers’ Guides and learners’ books. Special thanks are due to the Program Development and Implementation Team, which includes members of the Ministry of Education and other stakeholders. This team led the design of the program, the development of the scope and sequence, wrote the lesson plans themselves, and is overseeing the pilot of the materials in classrooms. This team includes experts who have been engaged in several parts of the activity, TAC tutors, coaches, teachers in PRIMR Cohort 1 schools, whose contributions to improving these materials are greatly appreciated, and the pupils and community members in Nairobi, Kiambu, Nakuru and Kisumu counties who have been heavily involved. The quality of this work is due to their tireless efforts. Thanks also to Masud Ramadhan Abdi and Apollo Erik for creating the illustrations. Finally, it is the effort, energy and talent of Kenyan pupils that inspires us.
