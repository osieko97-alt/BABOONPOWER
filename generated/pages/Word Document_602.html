<pre>INTRODUCTION

Aridity The United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) defines Arid, Semi-Arid and Dry Sub-Humid zones as ―areas, other than polar and sub-polar regions, in which the ratio of annual precipitation to potential evapotranspiration [the aridity index] falls within the range from 0.05 to 0.65.‖ Hyper-Arid zones are characterized by a ratio typically less than 0.05. Together, these arid environments account for over 47 percent of the land mass of the earth and are spread geographically across all continents. The African continent contains the largest area of arid environments, while Australia has the highest proportion — about 75% of its area. The intensity of aridity varies from one place to the other due to the variation of moisture deficit, and might even vary within one zone where various environmental factors play roles. Broad climatic attributes have been used to divide arid lands into three categories. Three arid zones can be delineated by this index: namely, hyper-arid, arid and semi-arid. 

 Hyper-Arid Zone

 Of the total land area of the world, the hyper-arid zone covers 4.2% the arid zone 14.6%, and the semi-arid zone 12.2%. Therefore, almost one-third of the total area of the world is arid land. The hyper-arid zone (arid index 0.03) comprises dryland areas without vegetation, with the exception of a few scattered shrubs. True nomadic pastoralism is frequently practiced. Annual rainfall is low, rarely exceeding 100 millimetres. The rains are infrequent and irregular, sometimes with no rain during long periods of several years. 2.1.7.2 Arid Zone The arid zone (arid index 0.03-0.20) is characterized by pastoralism and no farming except with irrigation. For the most part, the native vegetation is sparse, comprising of annual and perennial grasses and other herbaceous vegetation, and shrubs and small trees. There is high rainfall variability, with annual amounts ranging between 100 and 300 millimetres. 

Semi-Arid Zone 

The semi-arid zone (arid index 0.20-0.50) can support rain-fed agriculture with more or less sustained levels of production. Sedentary livestock production also occurs. Native vegetation is represented by a variety of species, such as grasses and grass-like plants, fortes and half-shrubs, and shrubs and trees. Annual precipitation varies from 300-600 to 700-800 millimetres, with summer rains, and from 200-250 to 450-500 millimetres with winter rains. Arid conditions also are found in the sub-humid zone (arid index 0.50-0.75). However, environmentalists have argued that aridity is a product of both natural and man-made activities. The natural factors as mentioned above include climatic factors such as rainfall, temperatures and evapotranspiration. Man-made factors on the other hand include deforestation, soil erosion among others. While the man-made factors can be mitigated, natural factors require adaptability. Thirty-five percent of earth‘s people live in arid and semi-arid lands. The drylands cover 6150 million hectares i.e. forty-seven percent (47.2%) of Earths‘ total land surface area and closely follow the world‘s map of poverty. While already exposed to climate extremes, according to IPCC, drylands are likely to be severely hit by climate change. Despite increase in population in arid areas, the concerns of populations living on these lands remain under-represented in climateaction, development discussions and national policies 2.1.8 Carrying Capacity Refers to the population size of the species that the given environment can sustain indefinitely given food, habitat, water and other necessitiess available in the environment. The determinants of carrying capacity include; water, ecological conditions, resource availability, population growth rate, policy framework and technology. Increasing population with lack of innovation and a clear policy framework on how to improve productivity of land will see a decline in the carrying capacity. The carrying capacity of land can be increased by applying the relevant technology and ensuring a conducive policy framework. Countries like Israel with more than half of their land as drylands have embraced relevant 17 technology and clear policy framework. This has increased the carrying capacity of their land thereby sustaining their population on a small land area.

THE ROLE OF IRRIGATION TECHNOLOGY IN TRANSFORMING ARID AND SEMI ARID LANDS

The role of irrigation technology

  Promotion of Food Security Over years, empirical experience has shown that irrigation increases yield of most crops by between 100 and 400 per cent (FAO, 2009). It is expected that, over the next 30 years, 70% of the grain production will be from irrigated land in the world. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO, 2009) estimates that irrigated land in developing countries will increase by 27%t in the next 20 years, but the amount of water expected to be available for agricultural production will only increase by a mere 12 per cent. In Sub-Saharan Africa, only 4% of crop land is irrigated compared to 1.8% for Kenya.  However, in many parts of the world, there are large untapped reserves of ground water. In addition, there is great potential for harvesting runoff water for farming especially in the lowlands and valley-bottoms that store water naturally. With reasonable investments, this potential could be unleashed for increased food security in this era of food insecurity and deteriorating natural resources and production conditions as a result of climatic changes

Irrigation Practices and Potential in Kenya The main irrigation schemes in the country are distributed over various agro ecological zones and regions, giving rise to unique opportunities for diversification, crop disease and pest control, low product market competition or gluts and less competition for water resources. The map below shows the location of the government managed schemes and the existing potential in various parts of the country. Location and size of existing public schemes and irrigation potential in Kenya According to the World Bank report, 2008, Kenya’s irrigated land as a percentage of Cropland is quite low and has stagnated at 1.6% since the year 2000 and rising marginally to 1.8% in 2003. The main irrigated crops are rice, maize, sugarcane, vegetables, bananas, citrus, coffee, tea, cotton and flowers. Some of these crops like maize, sugarcane, coffee, tea and cotton, technically, require large scales of operation for economic returns to be realized. As the ESP initiatives are being implemented care will have to be taken to guide the smallholders on the right crop for prevailing production systems. In this case, the implementation of ESP should go hand in hand with provision of adequate and focused extension, land use management, water use efficiency and environmental conservation in order to realize the anticipated results. Achievement of results normally would be the most reliable way of stimulating growth of irrigation that seems to be stagnating in Kenya. Introduction of fees or tariffs payable by water users is a sound decision to promote sustainability. The fees payable by the gravity water abstraction systems is pegged at Ksh 2000 per crop season whereas those who depend on pumping pay Ksh 4000 per crop season. These rates seem to have been arbitrarily decided as they do not change with 8 the change of diesel prices or the margin is high enough to absorb the price changes. Much more revenue can be generated from the schemes if appropriate technologies and cost effective designs could be put in place to improve scheme water use efficiency and save the producers of costs that are incurred due to low efficient systems.  The Irrigation Status in the Country Recent policy guidelines bringing on board various water management and user associations under the Ministry of Water and Irrigation are expected to improved water use efficiency to enable farmer put more land under irrigation. Even though, research institutions and other irrigation promoting agencies need to explore and introduce to the farmers yield improving technologies particularly in relation to improved seed, cultivation, harvesting and post harvest handling equipment. The present practices lack harvest equipment, yields achieved are low, postharvest losses are high and water supply is insufficient. Expansion by 4000 acres in Mwea scheme has been reported but production is done in rotational turns posing challenges of inability of NIB taking up critical issues as priority before expanding to other areas where the same constraints are likely to be realized soon after setting up costly systems. The water user and management associations have not been innovative enough to be able to tap the water resource from seasonal runoffs by way of storage and appropriate exploitation of the aquifer. Recurrent food insecurity among Kenyans has made scholars and institutions to look for solutions to alleviate the problem in the country. The issue of increasing cultivable land comes foremost since out of the 576,000km² only 17% is a high rainfall zone, receiving more than 1000 mm of rainfall annually and is arable enough to support farming without irrigation. The existing irrigation and drainage potential of 1.3 million and 600,000 ha respectively are within the second production zone that is characterized by medium rainfall of 750- 1000 mm per year occupying between 30 -35 percent of the country’s land area. Hitherto, 114,600 hectares are under irrigation and 30,000 ha drained. It is believed that out of the potential hectarage, 540,000 ha can be developed with the available water resources while the rest will require harvested and stored water. The land mainly under private smallholder irrigation is devoted to production of vegetables and fruits for export and the local market. These include Asian vegetables, Tomatoes, Spinach, Kales, brinjals, melons, corgets and chillies. Fruits include Mangoes, paw paws, bananas,</pre>
