<pre>NOUNS
NOUNS
COMPOUND NOUNS
Formation
Words can be combined to form 
compound nouns.
 These are very common, and new
combinations are invented almost daily. They normally have two parts. The 
second part
identifies the object or person in question (
man, friend, tank, table, room
). The 
first part
tells us what kind of object or person it is, or what its purpose 
is (
police, boy, water, dining,
bed
):
What type / what purpose
What or who
police
man
boy
friend
water
tank
dining
table
bed
room
The two parts may be written in a number of ways :
1. as one word.
Example: 
policeman
, 
boyfriend
2. as two words joined with a hyphen.
Example: 
dining-table
3. as two separate words.
Example: 
fish tank
.
There are no clear rules about this - so write the common compounds that you know well as
one word, and the others as two words.
The two parts may be:
Examples:
noun + noun
bedroom
water tank
motorcycle
printer cartridge
noun + verb
rainfall
haircut
train-spotting
noun + adverb
hanger-on
passer-by
verb + noun
washing machine
driving licence
swimming pool
verb + adverb*
lookout
take-off
drawback
