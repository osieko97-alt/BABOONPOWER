<pre>Passive and Active Voice (1)
Passive and Active Voice
English has two voices for verbs: 
the active and the passive
. The basic form is the active
verb, and follows the SVO pattern word order. The passive voice is derived from the active by
using the auxiliary verb &quot;to be&quot; and the past participle form of the main verb.
Examples of the passive:
Passive voice
Active voice
I am seen
I see
You will be struck
You will strike
It was stolen
It stole
We were carried
We carried
They have been chosen
They have chosen
Furthermore, the 
agent
 and 
patient
 switch grammatical roles between active and passive
voices so that in passive the patient is the subject, and the 
agent
 is noted in an optional
prepositional phrase using 
by
, for example:
1.
active: 
I heard the music.
2.
passive: 
The music was heard (by me).
 (Note: 
me
, not 
I
)
The passive form of the verb is formed by replacing the verb with 
to be
 in the same tense and
aspect, and appending the past participle of the original verb. Thus:
Tense
Active voice
The same sense, expressed with the passive
voice
Simple present
I 
hear
 the music.
The music 
is heard
 by me.
Present progressive
I 
am hearing
 the music.
The music 
is being heard
 by me.
Past progressive
I 
was hearing
 the
music.
The music 
was being heard
 by me.
Past perfect
I 
had heard
 the music.
The music 
had been heard
 by me.
Simple future
I 
will hear
 the music.
The music 
will be heard
 by me.
This pattern continues through all the composite tenses as well. The semantic effect of the
change from active to passive is the depersonalization of an action. It is also occasionally used
to topicalize the direct object of a sentence, or when the agent is either unknown or
unimportant even when included, thus:
1.
The plane was shot down.
2.
Dozens were killed.
3.
Bill was run over by a bus.
There is a third &#x27;voice&#x27; in English, related to the classic &quot;middle&quot; voice. In this, the patient
becomes the subject, as in passive, but the verb remains in apparently active voice, no agent
can plausibly be supplied, and generally an adverbial modifies the entire construction. Thus:
1.
She doesn&#x27;t frighten easily.
2.
This bread slices poorly.
3.
His novels sell well.
4.
Campbell&#x27;s - the soup that eats like a meal (TM).
