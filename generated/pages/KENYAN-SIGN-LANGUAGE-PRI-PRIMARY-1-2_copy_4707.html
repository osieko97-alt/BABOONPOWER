FOREWORD  The Basic Education Curriculum Framework (BECF) outlines the vision and mission for the curriculum reforms. The Vision of the curriculum reforms is to develop “an engaged, an empowered and ethical citizen “while the mission is to “to nurture the potential of every learner”. The framework adopts a Competency Based Curriculum and has identified seven core competences, namely; communication and collaboration, critical thinking and problem solving, creativity and imagination, citizenship, digital literacy, learning to learn, and self-efficacy. It provides a variety of opportunities for identification and nurturing of learner’s potentials and talents in preparation for life and the world of work. It is geared towards making learning enjoyable. The curriculum designs are developed to enable implementation of the Basic Education Curriculum Framework. The design contains the National Goals of Education, outlines the Early Years Education (EYE), subject general and specific learning outcomes. It also suggests a variety of learning experiences, assessment, resources and links the topics to values, Pertinent and Contemporary Issues (PCI) and to other subjects. It is my hope that all educators in Early Years Education level will anchor their delivery of Basic and Teacher education on these Curriculum Designs.     FRED MATIANG’I PHD, EGH CABINET SECRETARY MINISTRY OF EDUCATION           

INTRODUCTION  The Pre-primary curriculum design has been developed to embrace the competence based learning approach as stipulated in the basic education curriculum frame-work (BECF).  The curriculum design is available in two volumes which cater for children at the pre-primary level in the country. It has been divided into two levels: Level I (pre-primary 1) for children aged four years and  Level II (pre-primary 2) for children aged five years. The curriculum covers the following learning areas: Language/Kenyan Sign Language, Mathematical, Environmental, Psychomotor and Creative and Religious Education activity areas.  Each learning activity area has both the general and specific learning outcomes clearly stipulated. The learning experiences and the key inquiry questions have also been provided specifically to give guidance to the users during the curriculum delivery process.  The curriculum has clearly identified core competences to be acquired by learners as they engage in activities in different learning areas. These core competences include: communication and collaboration, critical thinking and problem solving, imagination and creativity, citizenship, digital literacy, learning to learn and self-efficacy.   Pertinent and contemporary issues (PCIs) have been integrated into the curriculum design to prepare learners for the ever changing society specifically in order to address the changing needs of the society and ensure the learner’s safety. These include life skills development through storytelling, living values, moral values and social responsibility.    This curriculum emphasizes hands-on experiences as learners manipulate real objects and models.  Interaction with nature is also emphasized whereby learners are encouraged to observe living and non-living things in their immediate surroundings as well as during nature walk, field trips or visits to places of interest.  The curriculum emphasizes holistic development of the learner. This can be achieved by embracing the thematic integrated learning approach which is ideal for teaching learners in their formative stage of development.  The themes are derived from things and situations that learners are likely to interact with in everyday life.  Each theme is expected to cuts across all the activity areas.  Learning at the pre- primary level is expected to be flexible hence a theme may be interrupted to enable learners use an emerging situation as the learning theme for the period.

ii		National Goals of Education The Framework will be anchored on the National Goals of Education.  Education in Kenya should: 1. Foster nationalism, patriotism, and promote national unity Kenya’s people belong to different communities, races and religions and should be able to live and interact as one people.  Education should enable the learner acquire a sense of nationhood and patriotism. It should also promote peace and harmonious co-existence.   2. Promote social, economic, technological and industrial needs for national development Education should prepare the learner to play an effective and productive role in the nation.  a) Social Needs Education should instill social and adaptive skills in the learner for effective participation in the family, community, national, regional and international development.  b) Economic Needs Education should prepare a learner with requisite competences that support a modern and independent growing economy. This should translate into high standards of living for every individual.  c) Technological and Industrial Needs Education should develop in the learner necessary competences for technological and industrial development for the nation in tandem with global trends.  3. Promote individual development and self-fulfillment Education should provide opportunities for the learner to develop to the fullest potential. This includes development of one’s  interests, talents and character for positive contribution to the society.  4.

It should be geared towards developing a self-disciplined and ethical citizen with sound moral and religious values.

Education should also provide the learner with opportunities to develop and practice shared responsibility and accountability through community service learning.   6. Promote respect for and development of Kenya’s rich and varied cultures Education should instill in the learner appreciation of Kenya’s rich and diverse cultural heritage.  The learner should value own and respect other people’s culture as well as embrace positive cultural practices in a dynamic society.   7. Promote international consciousness and foster positive attitudes towards other nations Kenya is part of the interdependent network of diverse peoples and nations.  Education should empower the learner to respect, appreciate and participate in the opportunities within the international community.  Education should also enable the learner to operate within the international community with full knowledge of the obligations, responsibilities, rights and benefits that this membership entails.   8.
