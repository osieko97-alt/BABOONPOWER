ORAL  LITERATURE 
AND  
POETRY  
 
 

 POETRY.  
 
What is poetry?  
It is not easy to say what exactly poetry is.  But poetry explores the possibility of language more vividly than 
prose.  In poetry language is used in a powerful ways.  
 
ODAMO:  But then sir, what is poetry?  
TEACHER:  Why sir, it is much easier to say what it is not.  We all know what light is, but it is not easy to tell 
what it is.  
 
Poetry expresses language more powerfully than prose.  Poetry can be compared to a palace if prose is a hou se.  
So just as a palace is more than a house, but it must be a house at least so also poetry is more than prose but it 
must still be language at least.  
 
Attitude  
We can define attitude into two:  
i) The poets attitude towards his subjects (what he is writing about)  
ii) A poet may choose to write about attitudes that are not his.  His subjects (characters in his poem) can have their 
own attitudes towards one another or towards a certain issue e.g  in the poem, ‘Building the Nation (9) what is the 
drivers attitude t owards the PS? Sometimes a poet may show disapproval without using negative words.  In the 
poem, ‘Cow for breakfast’(16) the author disapproves his subject without using negative words instead he makes us 
laugh at him.  This is called satire .  Satire  is th e mocking or ridiculing or ridiculing people and their characteristics 
to expose their foolishness and weaknesses.  
 In the poem, cow for breakfast (16) greed is satirized without being  
mentioned.  In satire the poet attacks indirectly.  
 
Irony:    
Is the expression of the writers meaning by the use of language,  
which says the direct opposite of his thought.  In the book ‘Song of Lawino’ when Lawino calls Clementine Beautiful, 
she in fact means that she thinks Clementine is very ugly.  Beautiful is therefor e used ironically.  
 
 
 

 Sarcasm:  
  Is a bitter or wounding remark, which is often ironically worded.  Sarcasm just refers to the tone of voice in which a 
remark has been made e.g when Lawino calls Clementine beautiful she is being sarcastic because she is bi tter and 
contemptuous.  In the poem ‘Building the Nation” (9) the whole tone of the poem is satirical.  The title is ironic.  
 
ix)   Mood and tone:   
Mood is the condition someone is in and mood is usually expressed by the tone of voice one uses. If you want to 
see somebody in authority eg. Headmaster for a favour, you will not go to  him when he is in a bad mood but you will 
wait until the day when he is in a good mood.  But in poetry we don’t talk of bad and good mood.  Instead we use 
words like happy, bitter, angry, violent, quiet, resigned, sad, pleasant, resentful, humorous etc.  
In the poem, “The woman I married”(19) the mood is humorous and  resi - gned. This can be established by the words 
used in the poem. He does not  
 
call her his wife but instead he calls her ‘the Woman I married’.  He does not say she is a typist but says she bangs the 
typewriter, and now she bangs the crockery so that the hou se sounds like a factory.  In this poem we see that he is not 
planning to send her away or discipline her in any way but he has just given up (resigned).  
 
The poem, “Grass will grow; (20) is sad, even desperate.  Tone is the voice used in a poem.  It refer  to the words in 
the poem.   
 
(x) Stanza.  Is a paragraph of lines in a poem.  
 
I ask for tears  
Do not send me moon hard madness  
To lodge snug in my skull  
I would you sent me hordes of horses  
Galloping  
Crushing.  
But do not break  
The York of the moon on me.  
Jonathan Kariara.  
 
Poem no.21 .  The Philosophers  

 ‘Those who speak know nothing;  
Those who know are silent’.  
These words, as I am told,  
Were spoken by Lao -Tzu.  
If we were to believe that Lao -Tsu 
Was himself one who knew,  
How comes is that he wrote a book  
Of five thousand words  
To Chui

STUDYING ORAL LITERATURE.  
How we can be exposed to Oral Literature.  
Oral stories are told to us from a very early age.  When we are old enough we start telling those stories ourselves.  
We attend various ceremonies where we listen to songs and experience various dances and other utterances and 
performances.  
 
At funerals stories would be told to adults about spirits and the underworld.  
In everyday conversation the elders use proverbs and imaginative language which qualify as Oral Literature.  
Some samples of Oral Literature have been written in books which we can buy and read.  
The mass media also present some programmes that are Oral Literature oriented.  But sometimes we are hampered 
from being exposed to Oral Literature.  
 
Why?  
The occasions of performance are irr egular and unsystematic.  Also some people move to urban areas and grow up in a 
sort of vacuum as far as the African background is concerned.  So they remain culturally rootless and in most cases ‘ape’ 
foreign cultures.  So, to rediscover ourselves, we sho uld study Oral Literature.  For us to understand ourselves in the 
present  
time we should discover our roots.  
 
Taban Lo Liyong’ says,’ just as we don’t want the Africa of our fore fathers forgotten, we also want the Africa of our 
grand children realized as  well as living meaningfully in our times.  He says that, ‘we are like a strange beast with three 
heads – one looks perpetually behind, one looks steadily under our feet and the other is poised to heavens dreamily.  
In order to reach our rural people – who are the majority – and serve them effectively, we should have an 
understanding of oral literature which they still use to this day.  
 The study of oral literature is necessary as it is likely to expose us to some of the best creative productions of the 
huma n mind.  
 
 
 
How to Study Oral Literature.  

 For a successfully study of anything one must have a direct access to it.  So we should have direct contact with Oral 
Literature, ready to watch and listen to performances of oral literature.  
i)  When we have opportunity, we should be ready to seek out these  
     performances, going out to places and occasions where such  
    performances are likely to take place.  
ii) We should know how to classify our Oral Literature – as we have already done  for you but remember that each 
society has its own classifications.  
iii) We should be able to analyse (dissect) some samples of Oral Literature in order to see how they are put together 
and how they work.  We look at the content (subject matter and themes ), organization and presentation (the 
structure, development and style used by composer and performers).  
iv) Lastly we interpret the Oral piece in terms of its significance to the society.  What lessons it teaches the society.  
 
How Oral Literature Relates to Society.  
Oral Literature cannot be seen as arts for arts sake.  Whether narratives, song, proverbs or riddles, it relates to the 
culture of the people who create it; their beliefs, customs and accepted norms; their likes and dislikes.  
 
A study of Oral Literature amounts to studying the society which creates it.  This would involve field research.  
Children were brought up according to the norms of their society through narratives, songs, proverbs and riddles.  
Very young children (corresponding to our nur sery kids today) were told.  
 
 
 
There is a pot by the altar  
That they begun to mould;  
They finished the base  
But the neck remains undone…  
For they ran out of mud.  
 
Mud! Mud!  
Who can find mud  
Maybe if it were gold  
Someone would.

Poem No. 19.  T he Woman I married  
The woman I married  
Is an out -right bone -shaker.  
 
For a full decade  
She had banged a typewriter  
And now in substitution  
Bangs the crockery  
Until my house sounds like a factory.  
 
The noise keeps her sane.  
They say  
Edwin Waiyaki.   
 
The following are common oral literature  and poetry asked questions. It is advisable to do the questions in groups:  
 
  
1.  Read the poem and answer the questions which follow.  
 
THE MARKET WOMAN  
 
The market woman  
Strong sun  
and the market woman in the shade  
of the mulemba  
 
- Orange, my lady  
a nice little orange!  
 
Light plays in the town  
its  burning game  
of brightness and shade  

 and life plays  
in worried hearts  
its game of blind -man’s buff.  
 
The market woman  
who  sells fruit  
sells herself.  
 
- My Lady  
orange, nice little orange!  
 
Buy sweets oranges  
buy  from  me too the bitterness  
of this torture  
of life without life  
 
buy from me the childhood of the spirit  
this rosebud  
that did not open  
start still impelled to a beginning.  
 
Orange, my lady!  
I exhausted the smiles  
with which I cried  
I no longer cry.  
And there goes my hopes  
as  did the blood of my children  
mingled with the dust of roads  
buried on plantations  
and my sweat  
soaked in the cotton threads.  
 
As effort was offered to  

 the  security of machines  
the beauty of tarmac roads  
of tall buildings  
comfort or ricy gentlemen  
happiness dispersed in towns  
and I  
became a part  
of the very problems of existence.  
 
There go the oranges  
as  I offered myself to alcohol  
to anaesthetize myself  
and stupefied myself to live.  
 
I gave all.  
 
Even my pain  
and  the poetry of my naked breasts  
I gave to the poets.  
 
Now I myself am selling me  
 
Buy oranges!  
my  lady!  
Take me to the markets of life  
My price is only one: - Blood.  
 
Perhaps selling myself  
I posses my self  
- Buy oranges!
