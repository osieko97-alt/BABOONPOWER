STRAND 2.0: CREATING AND PERFORMING IN CREATIVE ARTS AND 
SPORTS  
PICTURE MAKING  
Picture Making is the custom design and production of pictures, from either your own 
digital image files or from our gallery images, to create a unique and exciting art piece, 
perfect for your space.  
Drawing  
Drawing  is a visual art that uses an instrument to mark paper or another two -dimensional 
surface. The instrument might be pencils, crayons, pens with inks, brushes with paints, or 
combinations of these, and in more modern times  
Principles of Visual arts.  
There are two principles of visual arts namely:  
1. Principle of dominance.  
2. Principle of proportion.  
 
Principle of dominance(emphasis) in Visual Arts.  
 Dominance is when a single element is so large and/or different compared to the rest 
of the design that it dominates. It grabs your attention.   
 It contributes to organic unity by emphasizing the fact that there is one main feature 
and that other elements are subordinate to it  
 
Elements of visual arts  
Artists use many tools to get their jobs done - paintbrushes, pens, pencils, easels, canvas, 
etc.- but what most people don&#x27;t see are the principles and elements that guide the use of 
these tools. If pencils an d paintbrushes are the tools of art, then the principles and 
elements are how one uses these tools. They give artists structure and balance, which is 
key to creating a beautiful art piece.  
There are seven main elements and eight main principles that guide  all art forms.  

 
 
The elements are:  
 Shape  
 Space  
 Texture  
 Form  
 Color  
 Line 
 value.  
The principles are balance, unity, variety/repetition, perspective, proportion, harmony, 
emphasis, and rhythm/movement.  
All art uses some blend of many or all of these aspects  in order to be pleasing to the eye 
or to communicate its message. For example, Grant Wood&#x27;s Fall Plowing uses a blend of 
color, repetition, line, shape and balance to bring his piece to life. He uses bold greens, 
yellows and reds, hard, flowing crop lines , and repetition of fun shapes to guide the 
viewer&#x27;s eye over what seems to be a fairly serene scene of a freshly plowed field.  
 To analyze the visual elements of visual arts one has to Consider the composition, 
colors, textures, size, space, and other visu al and material attributes of the artwork  
 
The seven principles of visual arts  
1. Balance  
 refers  to the visual weight of the elements of the composition. It is a sense that the 
painting feels stable and &quot;feels right.&quot; Imbalance causes a feeling of discomfort in the 
viewer.  
Balance can be achieved in 3 different ways:  
 
 Symmetry , in which both sides o f a composition have the same elements in the 
same position, as in a mirror -image, or the two sides of a face.  

 Asymmetry , in which the composition is balanced due to the contrast of any of 
the elements of art. For example, a large circle on one side of a c omposition 
might be balanced by a small square on the other side  
 Radial symmetry , in which elements are equally spaced around a central point, as 
in the spokes coming out of the hub of a bicycle tire.  
 
Contrast   
This is the difference between elements of art in a composition, such that each element 
is made stronger in relation to the other. When placed next to each other, contrasting 
elements command the viewer&#x27;s attention. Areas of contrast are among the first places 
that a viewer&#x27;s eye is drawn. Contrast  can be achieved by juxtapositions of any of the 
elements of art. Negative/Positive space is an example of contrast. Complementary 
colors placed side by side is an example of contrast.  
Notan is an example of contrast.  
 
 
Emphasis  
This is when the artist  creates an area of the composition that is visually dominant and 
commands the viewer&#x27;s attention. This is often achieved by contrast.  
 
 


Movement  
is the result of using the elements of art such that they move the viewer&#x27;s eye around 
and within the image. A sense of movement can be created by diagonal or curvy lines, 
either real or implied, by edges, by the illusion of space, by repetition, by energetic 
mark -making.  
Pattern  
 is the uniform repetition of any of the elements of art or any combination thereof. 
Anything can be turned into a pattern through repetition. Some classic patterns are 
spirals, grids, weaves. For examples of different pattern types see the Artlandia 
Glossary  of Pattern Design. A popular drawing practice is Zentangles, in which an 
abstract or representational outline is divided into different areas, each of which 
contains a unique pattern.  
 
Rhythm   
This is created by movement implied through the repetition of elements of art in a non -
uniform but organized way. It is related to rhythm in music. Unlike pattern, which 
demands consistency, rhythm relies on variety.  
 
Unity/Variety You want your painting to feel unified such that all the elements fit 
together comfort ably. Too much unity creates monotony, too much variety creates 
chaos.You need both. Ideally, you want areas of interest in your composition along 
with places for your eye to rest.  
 
PAINTING  
Colour wheel  
Colour wheel a diagram used in the visual arts to represent the colours of the visible 
spectrum and their relationships to one another.  
The colours are arranged systematically into a circle, with each hue usually falling into 
one of three categories:  
1. Primary  

2. Secondary  
3. intermediate.  
 
Colour gradation str ip for colour contrast  
Start with your chosen colour at the top of the column on your palette (cool blues below 
the cool blue column, warm reds below the warm red column) and apply in a broad band 
on your canvas.  
Back to your palette, add white to your col our and mix it in the column below the first 
colour.  
 
Still life drawing  
Still Life drawing is literally creating a two dimensional image of inanimate objects. 
Various media are used to emphasize a skill or topic. Still Life drawings created as 
prelimina ry studies for paintings are typically pencil, pastels, or pen and ink.  


A still life drawing is created by placing objects in a design setting that utilizes available 
light and contrasts in shapes in an eye pleasing manner. The artist sketches the basic 
shapes first and continues to fill in details and/or color until the desired outcome is 
achieved.  
The placement design may be random or organized to depict an event, emphasize a study 
in specific shapes, or send a message or statement.  
What is the example of  still life drawing?  
Examples of still life drawings include memento mori and vanitas drawings. The 
memento mori depict the impending mortality of man.  
Vanitas drawing allude to the vanity of man as corruption and doom. Both styles use 
skulls to represent  death and clocks or watches to represent time passing.  
Still life with complementary colours  
The aim of this exercise was to make a colour study of a still life using a narrow range of 
colours comprised of one colour, its  complementary and white to lighten tones.  
 
 
RYTHMS  
Rhythm is the pattern of sound, silence, and emphasis in a song 
  Melody - a melody is a 
combination of pitch and rhythm.  
To understand and be able to write rhythmic patterns dictated, one needs to fol low the 
following tips:  


 Establish the beat of the rhythm patterns.  
 Clap or tap the full rhythm before you start writing.  
 Break down the rhythm into bars and write one bar at a time while clapping the 
whole rhythmic pattern.  
 Clap through the rhythmic pa ttern you have written to check if it conforms to the 
rhythm dictated.  
This time signature gives us three beats per measure, with the quarter note getting one 
beat. It&#x27;s the signature behind the graceful waltz and many folk and pop songs. If you 
count a r hythmic one -two-three, one -two-three, you&#x27;re feeling the sway of the 3/4 time.  
The number  of notes  allowed  in each measure  is determined  by the time  signature . As 
you saw in the time signature  examples  above,  each time signature  has two numbers:  a 
top number  and a bottom  
number:  2/4 time,  3/4 time,  4/4 time,  3/8 time,  9/8 time,  4/2 time,  3/1 time,  and so on. 
The bottom  number  of the time signature  indicates  a certain  kind of note used to count  
the beat,  and the top note reveals  how many  beats  are in each measure.  If you look at the 
American  note names  from  the chart  above,  there  is a fun little trick to it: 
Take  the 2/4-time signature  for example  - with the 2 on the top of the time signature  you 
know  there  are 2 beats  for one measure,  and this leaves  you with a fraction  of 1/4—a 
quarter,  the note-length  the time signature  is indicating  to you then is a quarter  note.  
Therefore,  you know  that there  are two quarter  notes  worth  of time in every  measure:  
 
 Let’s  try another  one. In 9/8 time,  you know  that in every  measure  there  are 9 notes  in 
a 1/8 length.  
 
 How  about  in 4/2 time?  
 


 
 In 4/2 time,  each measure  has 4 notes  of 1/2, so we have  4 1/2  notes:  
 Now  try 3/1 time.  
 In 3/1 time,  so we have  3 notes  of a 1/1 length,  so 3 whole  notes!  
 
The time signature 3/ 4 tells a musician that a quarter note represents one beat in a 
measure (the lower number) and that there will be three beats in each measure (the top 
number).  
Time Signature 3/4 Explained Time Signature 3/4 is one of the most popular meters in 
western music. Each measure (or bar) has 3 quarter notes beats in it. The waltz is a 
classic piece of music in 3/4 and listening to it gives you the ‘swing’ feel of this meter.  
 
What Is Time Signature 3/4?  
The time signature or meter 3/4 is show in the music as a 3 above a 4.   
 
This comes before the music starts but after the clef and key signature. The ‘3’ stands for 
3 beats per measure and the ‘4’ tells us that each beat is a quarte</pre>
