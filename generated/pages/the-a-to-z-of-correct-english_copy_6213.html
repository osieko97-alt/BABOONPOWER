Introduction
The A–Z of Correct English is a reference book which has been
written for the student and the general reader. It aims to tackle thebasic questions about spelling, punctuation, grammar and word usage
that the student and the general reader are likely to ask.
Throughout the book there are clear explanations, and exemplar
sentences where they are needed. When it’s helpful to drawattention to spelling rules and patterns, these are given so that thereader is further empowered to deal with hundreds of related words.The aim always has been to make the reader more conﬁdent andincreasingly self-reliant.
This is a fast-track reference book. It is not a dictionary although,
like a dictionary, it is arranged alphabetically. It concentrates on
problem areas; it anticipates diﬃculties; it invites cross-references. By
exploring punctuation, for example, and paragraphing, it goes far
beyond a dictionary’s terms of reference. It is not intended toreplace a dictionary; it rather supplements it.
Once, in an evening class, one of my adult students said, ‘If
there’s a right way to spell a word, I want to know it.’ On anotheroccasion, at the end of a punctuation session on possessive
apostrophes, a college student said rather angrily, ‘Why wasn’t I told
this years ago?’
This book has been written to answer all the questions that my
students over the years have needed to ask. I hope all who now useit will have their questions answered also and enjoy the conﬁdenceand the mastery that this will bring.

How to use this book
For ease of reference, all the entries in this book have been listed
alphabetically rather than being divided into separate spelling, usage,punctuation and grammar sections.
You will therefore ﬁnd hypocrisy following hyphens ;
paragraphing following paraﬃn ;who or whom? following
whiskey or whisky? ; and so on.
WANT TO CHECK A SPELLING?
Cross-referencing will help you locate words with tricky initial
letters.
aquaint Wrong spelling. See
ACQUAINT .
Plural words are given alongside singular nouns, with cross-
referencing to relevant rules and patterns.
knife (singular) knives (plural). See PLURALS (v).
There is also a general section on plurals and another on foreign
plurals .
If it’s the complication of adding an ending that is causing you
trouble, you will ﬁnd some words listed with a useful cross-
reference.
dining or dinning? dine + ing = dining (as in dining room)
din + ing = dinning (noise dinning in ears)
See ADDING ENDINGS (i) and (ii) .
There are individual entries for confusing endings like -able/-ible ;
-ance,-ant/-ence,-ent ;-cal/-cle ;-ise or -ize? and for confusing
beginnings like ante-/anti- ;for-/fore- ;hyper-/hypo- ;inter-/intra-
and many others.

abandon abandoned, abandoning, abandonment

abattoir (not-bb-)
abbreviate abbreviated, abbreviating, abbreviation
(not-b-)
abbreviations See CONTRACTIONS .
-able/-ible Adjectives ending in -able or -ible can be
diﬃcult to spell because both endingssound identical. You’ll always need to beon guard with these words and check
each word individually when you are in
doubt, but here are some usefulguidelines:
(i) Generally use -able when the
companion word ends in -ation:
abominable, abomination
irritable, irritation
(ii) Generally use -ible when the
companion word ends in -ion:
comprehensible, comprehension
digestible, digestion
(iii) Use -able after hard c and hard g:
practicable (c sounds like k)
navigable (hard g)
(iv) Use -ible after soft c and soft g:
forcible (c sounds like s)
legible (g sounds like j)

abridgement/ Both spellings are correct. Use either but be
abridgment consistent within one piece of writing.
abscess This is a favourite word in spelling
quizzes.
(notabsess or abcess)
absence absent ( notabsc-)
absolute absolutely ( notabsoloute, absoloutely)
absorb absorption. Notice how b changes to p
here.
abstract nouns See NOUNS .
accept or except? We ACCEPT your apology.
Everybody was there EXCEPT Stephen.
accessary If you want to preserve the traditional
or accessory? distinction in meaning between these two
words, use ACCESSARY to refer to
someone associated with a crime andACCESSORY to refer to something that is
added (a fashion accessory or caraccessories). However, the distinction hasnow become blurred and it is perfectly
acceptable to use one spelling to cover
both meanings. Of the two, accessory isthe more widely used, but both arecorrect.
accessible (not-able)
accidentally The adverb is formed by adding -ly to
accidental.
(notaccidently)
accommodation This is a favourite word in spelling quizzes
and is frequently seen misspelt on paintedsigns.
(notaccomodation or accommadation)
accross Wrong spelling. See
ACROSS .
accumulate ( not-mm-)ABRIDGEMENT/ABRIDGMENT

­achieve achieved, achieving, achievement ( not-ei-)

acknowledgement/ Both spellings are correct but be
acknowledgment consistent within one piece of writing.
acquaint acquainted ( notaq-)
acquaintance (not-ence)
acquiesce acquiesced, acquiescing ( notaq-)
acquiescence (not-ance)
acquire acquired, acquiring, acquisition
(notaq-)
acreage Note that there are three syllables here.
(notacrage)
across (notaccross)
adapter or adaptor? Traditional usage would distinguish
between these two words and reserve-er for the person (an adapter of novels,for instance) and -or for the piece ofelectrical equipment. However, the
distinction has become very blurred and
the two spellings are considered by many
authorities to be interchangeable. Useeither for both meanings but be consistentwithin a single piece of writing.
addendum (singular) addenda (plural)
See
FOREIGN PLURALS .
adding endings Usually endings (suﬃxes) can be added to
base words without any complications.You just add them and that is that!
e.g. iron + ing = ironing
steam + er = steamer
list + less = listless
However, there are four groups of wordswhich need especial care. Fortunately,there are some straightforward rulesADDING ENDINGS

which save your learning thousands of
words individually.
(i)The 1-1-1 rule
This rule applies to:
words of ONE syllableending with ONE consonantpreceded by ONE vowel
e.g. drop, ﬂat, sun, win.
When you add an ending beginning
with a consonant to a l-l-l word, thereis no change to the base word:
drop + let = droplet
ﬂat + ly = ﬂatly
win + some = winsome
When you add an ending beginning
with a vowel to a l-l-l word, youdouble the ﬁnal letter of the baseword:
drop + ed = dropped
ﬂat + est = ﬂattestwin + ing = winningsun + *y = sunny
*y counts as a vowel when it
sounds like i or e.See
VOWELS .
Treat qu as one letter:
quit + ing = quitting
quip + ed = quipped
Don’t double ﬁnal w and x. They
would look very odd and so we havecorrectly:
tax + ing = taxing
paw + ed = pawed
(ii)The magic -e rule
This rule applies to all words endingADDING ENDINGS

­with a silent -e.
e.g. hope, care, achieve, sincere,separate.
When you add an ending beginning
with a consonant, keep the -e:
hope + ful = hopeful
care + less = careless
sincere + ly = sincerelyseparate + ly = separatelyachieve + ment = achievement
When you add an ending beginning
with a vowel, drop the -e:
hope + ing = hoping
care + er = carersincere + ity = sincerity
separate + ion = separation
achieve + ed = achieved
Do, however, keep the -e in words
like singeing (diﬀerent from singing)and dyeing (diﬀerent from dying) and
whenever you need to keep the
identity of the base word clear (e.g.shoeing, canoeing).
Do remember to keep the -e with
soft c and soft g words. It’s the e thatkeeps them soft (courageous,tr</pre>
