WRITING NUMBERS IN ENGLISH
NUMBERS
Hundred
In English, the hundreds are perfectly regular, except that the word 
hundred 
remains in its
singular form regardless of the number preceding it (nevertheless, one may on the other hand
say &quot;hundreds of people flew in&quot;, or the like)
100 = one hundred
200 = two hundred
…
…
900 = nine hundred
Thousand
So too are the thousands, with the number of thousands followed by the word &quot;thousand&quot;
1,000 = one thousand
2,000 = two thousand
…
…
10,000 = nine thousand
999,000 = nine hundred and ninety-nine thousand (BrE) nine hundred ninety-nine
thousand (AmE)
Note that in American English, many students are taught not to use the word and anywhere in
the whole part of a number, so it is not used before the tens and ones. It is instead used as a
verbal delimiter when dealing with compound numbers. Thus, instead of &quot;three hundred and
seventy-three&quot;, one would say &quot;three hundred seventy-three&quot;.
Numbers above a million
1,000,000 = one million
1,000,000,000 = one billion 1,000,000,000,000 = one trillion four billion dollars = $4 billion
16,500,000 = 16.5 million
912,757,250 =
nine hundred and twelve million, seven
hundred and fifty seven thousand, two
hundred and fifty QUANTITY

Specialized numbers
A few numbers have special names (in addition to their regular names):
0: has several other names, depending on context:
o 
zero: 
formal scientific usage
o 
naught / nought: 
mostly British usage
o 
oh: 
used when spelling numbers (like telephone, bank account, bus line)
o 
nil: 
in general sport scores, British usage (
&quot;The score is two-nil.&quot;
)
o 
nothing: 
in general sport scores, American usage (
&quot;The score is two to nothing.&quot;
)
