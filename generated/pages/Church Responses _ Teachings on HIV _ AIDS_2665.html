Catholic Bishops of the Philippines wrote in 1993
“In announcing the Good News of salvation, in healing the sick, in forgiving sinners, in being compassionate with the multitude, Jesus showed what the Church must do. 
God’s people  must be at the side of those who suffer. Especially for the needy and suffering today, the Church must be the Compassion of Jesus.”

Pastoral Letter on AIDS : In The Compassion of Jesus, 
23 January 1993

The Church responds to the pandemic of HIV and AIDS as it does to every other human reality – from the depth of its mission:
As Servant
As Animator of spiritual life
		&amp; pastoral care
As Teacher





--- Slide 4 ---
As Servant Church
Church-based health care is responsible for some 50% of all health service delivery in developing countries.
 
These extend to rural areas and have     
   been among the first in treating    
   patients living with HIV/AIDS. 

--- Slide 6 ---
Programmes:
In-patient and out-patient health care
Home-based care (hospital- and community-based)
Voluntary Counseling and Testing 
Psycho-Social Support
Chaplaincy Services
Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission
Orphan care
Income-Generating Activities
Blood safety


--- Slide 7 ---
As animator of spiritual life &amp; pastoral care

--- Slide 8 ---
The Church is unique in its ability to offer pastoral care to those living – and dying – with or affected by HIV and AIDS

Church representatives need to speak openly about HIV and AIDS from the pulpit and in other settings.

Church leaders need to provide  prayer, liturgies, anointing services, memorial services, rituals and symbols that are meaningful.


--- Slide 9 ---
“Every local parish must establish itself as a privileged place where education about HIV &amp; AIDS is disseminated and persons most vulnerable to the virus or living with or affected by the virus receive Jesus’ healing love through the physical, emotional and spiritual support of the members.”
      - 2011 CBCP Pastoral letter on AIDS “Who is my neighbor?”

--- Slide 10 ---
“Church workers, seminarians &amp; the clergy, must be equipped with basic knowledge on HIV &amp; AIDS and pastoral counseling skills …to bring hope, healing and reconciliation to those vulnerable to the virus, those infected and affected by HIV, through the sacraments and pastoral care.”
       - 2011 CBCP Pastoral Letter on AIDS “Who is my neighbor?”


--- Slide 11 ---
As Teacher




	

	
At the heart of episcopal teaching on HIV and AIDS is a call to return to the basic and solid values of the Gospel, with strong emphasis on compassion and service, and on responsibility and respect in sexual ethics: sexual activity within marriage only; sexual abstinence outside marriage.

--- Slide 12 ---
Pope Benedict XVI:
	“Hearts must be converted”

--- Slide 13 ---
“The God of Jesus Christ must be known, believed in and loved, 
	and hearts must be converted 
	if progress is to be made on social issues and reconciliation is to begin, and if – for example – AIDS is to be combated by realistically facing its deeper causes and the sick are to be given the loving care they need.


--- Slide 14 ---
Social issues and the Gospel are inseparable. 
When we bring people only knowledge, ability, technical competence and tools, we bring them too little.”Pope Benedict XVI, Homily in Munich, 20 September 2006,

--- Slide 15 ---
Church teaching:Both individual and social values
“In many cases, HIV/AIDS implies problems also at the level of existential values; it is true pathology of the spirit which harms not only the body, but the whole person, interpersonal relationships and social life, and is often accompanied by a crisis of moral values.”

Source: Cardinal Javier Lozano Barragán at UN Special Session on AIDS July 2001


--- Slide 16 ---
“Parents &amp; educators need to teach, by their word and example, the dignity of the human person, the beauty and sacredness of human love anchored on God’s love. Chastity and monogamous fidelity are the best protection from HIV &amp; AIDS.”
	  - 2011 CBCP Pastoral letter on AIDS “Who is my neighbor?”

--- Slide 17 ---
Education continues to be the only effective “vaccine” to combat denial, ignorance, and prejudice which places people at risk of contracting HIV.

Catholic Bishops in Africareject the myth that AIDS is a punishment from God
Bishops of Southern Africa:
“AIDS must never be considered as a punishment from God.  He wants us to be healthy and not to die from AIDS.  It is for us 
	a sign of the times challenging all people to inner transformation and to the following of Christ in his ministry of healing, mercy and love.”
 A Message of Hope to the People of God from the Catholic Bishops of South Africa, Botswana, and Swaziland. July 30, 2001.

--- Slide 19 ---
2011 CBCP Pastoral letter “who is my neighbor?”
“Pervasive stigma associated with HIV &amp; AIDS is …a major barrier to an effective response...prevents people from talking about HIV and the behaviors that put them at risk for infection, and from seeking counsel and health services when such action could help protect themselves and their families from HIV infection.”

“Unfortunately, it exists in every corner of society,… even in our own faith communities.”

--- Slide 20 ---
Catholic Church leaders exercise their teaching role re: HIV prevention
In unanimous fashion, church leaders have upheld the fundamental values and teaching of the Church – especially with regard to sexual activities and human relationships – i.e. sexual abstinence outside marriage and mutual, life-long faithfulness within marriage.

With regard to the extent of information to be included in HIV prevention education, however, some different approaches and views are evident.


--- Slide 21 ---
CONSCIENCE – A MOST SECRET CORE AND SANCTUARy

“Deep within his conscience, man discovers a law which he has not laid upon himself but which he must obey. Its voice, ever calling him to love and to do what is right and to avoid evil, sounds in his heart at the right moment …  His conscience is man’s most secret core and his sanctuary. There he is alone with God whose voice echoes in his depths.”
The Documents of Vatican II, “Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World (Gaudium et spes)”, par. 16 New York: Herder and Herder, 1966.


--- Slide 22 ---
CONSCIENCE – A MOST SECRET CORE AND SANCTUARy
“We too preach the gospel, but we try above all to form consciences” [1]

 Discernment of right or wrong in human acts, including those related to prevention of HIV:
must take place with the benefit of Church’s teaching on right values related to individual behaviour as well as to  the common good
 with support and counseling  to hear the “voice of God” echoing in one’s conscience.

[1] Bishop Theodore Adrien Saar, President of Bishops’ Conference of Senegal at International Conference on AIDS in Religion, 1996.


--- Slide 23 ---
Southern African Bishops discuss the situation of discordant couples …
 “There are couples where one of the parties is living with HIV/AIDS … The Church accepts that everyone has the right to defend one’s life against mortal danger. This would include using the appropriate means and course of action.
         Similarly where one spouse is infected with HIV/AIDS they must listen to their consciences. They are the only ones who can choose the appropriate means in order to defend themselves against the infection. Decisions of such an intimate nature should be made by both husband and wife as equal and loving partners.”

A Message of Hope from the Catholic Bishops to the People of God in South Africa, Botswana, and Swaziland, 30 July 2001.

Ethical Issues Related toHIV Prevention

--- Slide 25 ---
25
Is  education about condom use for HIV prevention forbidden by Humanae Vitae?
“Each and every marital act must of necessity retain its intrinsic relationship to the procreation of life.” (Humanae Vitae, 11).

This document precedes our knowledge about HIV and thus could not have specifically addressed this issue.
Pope Paul VI considered as “intrinsically wrong” the  use of condoms and other artificially contraceptive means for purposes of  avoiding the transmission of new life.

--- Slide 26 ---

A bishop and pastor aboutpreventing sexual transmission of HIV
“The Church does not ‘advocate’ the use of condom as a means of struggling against AIDS; it advocates the fidelity of the couple and continence as the only means which are both efficacious and respectful of the dignity of the human person.

However, when someone decides to break the moral law concerning the exigencies of sexuality and love, the Church could not be opposed to that person taking the means to avoid catching or transmitting a mortal virus during their sexual relations.

But this person is not dispensed from questioning him or herself seriously about the morality of his or her behaviour and on the dehumanising character of his or her sexual life.”

	- Bishop Maurice E. Piat, C.S.SP., Bishop of Port-Louis, Mauritius, 27 November 2000, in Speak Out on HIV &amp; AIDS, Revised Edition, Nairobi, Kenya: Paulines Publications Africa, 2006, pp. 70-71.






--- Slide 27 ---
Maintaining identity and integrity in HIV prevention education – It IS possible!
“The teaching of the Church is not about condoms or similar physical or chemical devices, but about marital love and the essentially marital meaning of human sexuality … Stopping the worldwide AIDS epidemic is not a question about the morality of using condoms, but about how to effectively prevent people from causing the disastrous consequences of their immoral sexual behaviour …
Campaigns to promote abstinence and fidelity are certainly and ultimately the only effective long-term remedy to combat AIDS. So there is no reason for the Church to consider the campaigns promoting condoms a</pre>
