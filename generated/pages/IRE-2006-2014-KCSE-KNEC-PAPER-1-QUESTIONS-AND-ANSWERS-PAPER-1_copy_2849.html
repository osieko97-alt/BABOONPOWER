2KCSE 2006 PAPER 1 MARKING SCHEME
1 a) Reasons why the Quran is the Last and Final  Word of  God.
i.Quran was given  to the last Prophet, no other Prophet  will come after  Muhammad (s.a.w) 
and thus his revelation was considered the final revelation.
ii. The Quran is a miracle, it is beyond  human power, and this is because no  human being  
can reproduce  a copy similar to it.
iii. The Quran is addressed to the whole mankind whereas the previous  revelations were  
addressed to a particular people, for instance, Taurat was meant for the Jews only.
iv. The message of the Quran  is eternal,  since it is applicable  anywhere around the world and 
at all times  its judgment  is perfect putting in consideration the question of equity.
v. It guards the previous revelations and restores eternal truth thus guiding  humanity to the 
straight path.
vi. The teaching of the Quran is all encompassing, dealing with all aspects  of life e.g. moral. 
Legal, political,  social, economical and international  relations.
vii. It teaches about the histories of the past nations and their Prophets,  an indication that it is 
addressing the last Ummah no nation  will come after  it.
viii. The other revealed books were revealed before the Quran,  this is because the teachings  of 
the other revelations are included in the Quran thus the final revelation.
ix. The earlier revelation  has given a prophecy of  Prophet Muhammad (s.a.w) that he will 
come to complete  the chain  of Prophethood.
x. Other Prophets were sent to their own nations to  give guidance  but the message of Prophet 
Muhammad (P.B.U.H) was  for all humanity.
xi. The Quran is a complete book of guidance as it is a complete  way of  life.
xii. Prophet Muhammad to whom  the Quran was revealed  is the Seal of the prophets,  the final 
decisive Prophet after whom no more will come.  He  is Allah’s  decisive messenger  to whom 
the revelation of Quran was vouchsafed.
b) Why it is important to memorize the Quran.
i.Whoever  memorizes Qur’an and acts upon  it; Allah will reward him and honor him greatly 
for that, so that he will rise in status  in Paradise to a level  commensurate with what  he 
memorized of the Book of Allah.                                                                                                                                                                                     
Ibn &#x27;Amr reported that the Prophet (S.A.W) said: 
&quot;It will be said to the companion of the Qur’an after he has entered Paradise, &#x27;Recite,  
and rise!&#x27; For every verse  he recites he will rise  one level  (in Paradise), until he 
recites the last verse  with him (i.e., in his memory).&quot; (Abu Dawood)
ii. The Parents of the Memorizer of the Qur&#x27;an will receive  the highest Honor of  wearing a 
crown on the Day of Judgment.
It was narrated that Buraydah  said: “The Prophet (s.a.w) said: ‘Whoever reads the 
Qur’an, learns  it and acts in accordance with  it, on the Day of Resurrection his 
parents will be given a crown  to wear whose light will be like the light of  the sun, and 
his parents  will be given garments which  far surpass everything to  be found  in this  
world. They  will say, “Why have  we been given this to  wear?” It  will be said, 
“Because your child learned the Qur’an.”

3iii. For every letter the Memorizer  of the Qur&#x27;an recites is rewarded ten times  or more. The 
Prophet (s.a.w) said: “Whoever recites one Word from the Book of Allah  will be  
rewarded for a good deed and ten more  like it; and I don’t  say that Alif Lam Mim is a 
letter but Alif is a letter and Lam is a letter and  Mim is a letter”  (Tirmidhi &amp; Al-Darami)
iv.  The Qur&#x27;an will intercede for the Memorizer of  the Qur&#x27;an:  
It was narrated that Abu Umaamah al-Baahili said:  “I heard the Prophet (s.a.w) say: ‘Recite 
the Qur’an, for it will come  on the Day of Resurrection  to intercede for its 
companions. Recite  the two bright ones, al-Baqarah  and Surat Aal ‘Imraan,  for they 
will come on the Day of Resurrection like two clouds or two shades  or two flocks of 
birds in ranks,  pleading for those  who recite them. Recite Surat  al-Baqarah for to 
take recourse  to it is a blessing and to give it  up is a cause of  grief, and  the 
magicians cannot confront it.” (Muslim and Al-Bukhaari). 
v. The memorizer of the Qur’an  will be granted Jannah so long as he followed  the lawful and 
kept away  from the prohibited.
Hadrat Ali (RA) reports that the Prophet (s.a.w) said:
“Anyone who knows  the Quran  by heart and follows the lawful and the prohibited  
according to it, he will be  sent to Heaven by Allah .” (Tirmidhi).
vi. There is double  reward for those  who try hard to memorise the Qur&#x27;an
Aisha that the Prophet  (s.a.w)  said: The likeness  of the one who reads Quran and  
memorizes it is that he is with the righteous  honorable  scribes.  The likeness of  the 
one who reads it and tries  hard to memorize it  even  though it is difficult for him, he 
will have (at least)  a double  reward. (Al-Bukhaari)
vii. It is among the methods  of preserving  the message of the Quran hence enabling its 
perpetuation to the next generation.
viii. Memorization of the Quran is an act of ibadah, hence one is rewarded by Allah(s.w)
ix. Those who memorize  the Quran are held in high  esteem in the Ummah.
x. It helps in remembering and understanding the content  of the Quran.
xi. To maintain accuracy of the message of the Quran.
xii. Those  who have  memorized the Quran  are highly sought after and valued by the Islamic 
learning institutions and universities  and the world  of scholarship.
xiii. Necessary for perfection  of prayer.

42a) Teachings of Suratul Hujurat
i.This Surah begins by bringing up a point in regards to having discipline and order, while  in 
the presence of Allah and His Messenger.  The meaning of this discipline and order is that  
the Muslims must learn the commandments  and legislations of the religion from Allah and 
must not let their own inner desires and whims lead  them to  formulating laws and 
regulations.
ii.  The people who have true faith are instructed and  commanded how they should speak to  
their leaders. They  should be humble  and show respect  whenever speaking  to their leaders 
not to raise  their voices.
iii.  The people who have true faith are also commanded that when they are given news or 
testimony about  another person  from one who commits  sins in the open, is known for his  
wicked ways  or is not scared  of his transgressions (against  the laws of  Allah, Glorified  and 
Exalted is He), that they must not accept  such a testimony from him and must stay away  
from all forms  of rumors and gossip.
iv.  The general thoughts and opinions of the people have absolutely no value when compared 
to the orders and directives of the infallible  Prophet (blessings  of Allah  be upon him and his 
progeny).
v.  It is incumbent upon every  Muslim that he strives for peace, and to attain  this goal he must 
stand up against the oppressors so that he would be  able  to uphold  the truth  and maintain 
the rights of the oppressed.
vi. All Muslims are brothers (and sisters) of and equal to one another  and it is incumbent that 
they all endeavor  to ensure that peace  and happiness are  established amongst 
themselves.
vii. A Muslim does  not have the right to make fun of another Muslim. 
viii.  It is forbidden to find or pick faults  in other people according to the teachings of Islam.
ix.  A true believer does not have the right to call his brother  in faith by a nickname or bad 
name.
x.  It is forbidden (haram) to think bad thoughts  about a believing brother  (or sister). 
xi.  It is expressly forbidden to spy on or pry into the secrets and private life and affairs  of other 
people.
xii.  It is a major  sin to speak bad things behind the back of  another Muslim.
xiii.  In this Surah, the issue  of racial  superiority has also been brought to  an end and  the only 
criteria for judging who is better  (than another person) is one’s  merit, piety and  abstinence 
from those things  which  Allah (Glorified and Exalted  is He) has forbidden and by keeping  
away from all sins.
b) Guidelines on the Worship of Allah.
i.Worship  is dependent upon  revelation.  This means that there is no room for personal 
views in it. Rather, the only one who has the right to legislate what  is and isn’t worship is 
Allah, as He said quoting His Prophet: “I only follow what has been revealed to me.” 
[Surah Al-Ahqaaf: 9]
ii. Worship must  be done sincerely  for Allah’s sake and it must be free from any traces  of 
Shirk (polytheism), as Allah, the Most  High, says: “So whoever hopes  to meet his Lord 
then let him perform righteous deeds  and not mix any partners  into the worship of 
his Lord.” [ Al-Kahf: 110]

5iii. The person we follow  with regard to worship and the one who clarifies it to us is none
