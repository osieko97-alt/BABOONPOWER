Absolute Music   Music that is free from any reference to nonmusical ideas, such as a text or program.  
Abstract, Abstraction   Nonrepresentational; the essence of a thing rather than its actual appearance.  
Absurdism   A style dealing with life&#x27;s apparent meaninglessness and the difficulty or impossibility of human

Academy   From the grove (the Academeia) w here Plato taught; the term has come to mean the cultural and 
artistic establishment which exercises responsibility for teaching and the maintenance of standards.

particular area, such as an accent color. See also focal point.

Agent Of Change  A person or spirit that produces a significant change in a situation. The  witches in Macbeth, for 
instance, do not commit any outrageous crimes themselves, but we suspect that without them 
Macbeth would not become a murderous tyrant.  
Aleatory   Chance o r accidental. A term used for twentieth -century music in which the composer deliberately 
incorporates elements of chance.  
Allegory  A story illustrating an idea or a moral principle in which objects take on symbolic meanings. In 
Dante Alighieri&#x27;s Divi ne Comedy, Dante, symbolizing humankind, is taken by Virgil the poet on a 
journey through Hell, Purgatory and Paradise in order to teach him the nature of sin and its 
punishments, and the way to salvation.  
Alliteration  Used for poetic effect, a repetition of the initial sounds of several words in a group. The following 
line from Robert Frost&#x27;s poem Acquainted with the Night provides us with an example of 
alliteration: I have stood still and stopped the sound of feet. The repe tition of the &#x27;s&#x27; sound creates a 
sense of quiet, reinforcing the meaning of the line.  
Allusion  A reference in one literary work to a character or theme found in another literary work. T. S. Eliot, 
in The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock alludes (refe rs) to the biblical figure John the Baptist in the 
line, Though I have seen my head (grown slightly bald) brought in upon a platter . . . In the New 
Testament, John the Baptist&#x27;s head was presented to King Herod on a platter.  
Altarpiece   A painted or  sculpted panel placed above or behind an altar to inspire religious devotion.  
Ambiguity  A statement which can contain two or more meanings. For example, when the oracle at Delphi told

Analogy  The comparison of two things, which are alike in several respects, for the purpose of explaining or 
clarifying some unfamiliar or difficult idea or object by showing how the idea or object is similar to 
some familiar one. While simile and analogy often ove rlap, the simile is generally a more artistic 
likening, done briefly for effect and emphasis, while analogy serves the more practical purpose of 
explaining a thought process or a line of reasoning or the abstract in terms of the concrete, and may 
therefore  be more extended: You may abuse a tragedy, though you cannot write one. You may scold 
a carpenter who has made you a bad table, though you cannot make a table. It is not your trade to 
make tables. --Samuel Johnson  
Antagonist  A person or force which  opposes the protagonist in a literary work. In Stephen Vincent Benet&#x27;s The 
Devil and Daniel Webster, Mr. Scratch is Daniel Webster&#x27;s antagonist at the trial of Jabez Stone. 
The cold, in Jack London&#x27;s To Build a Fire is the antagonist which defeats the man  on the trail. The 
antagonist may not be obvious, in which case you could choose a candidate and discuss why he or 
she deserves to be thought of as the antagonist. An antagonist may not even be a person - or may be 
the same person as the main character. (S ee also Protagonist.)  
Anthropomorphic  With human characteristics attributed to nonhuman beings, or things.  
Antiphonal  A responsive style of singing or playing, in which two groups alternate.

Art Deco  An individual decorative art style that emerged between World War I and World War II. Its nam e 
was coined from the title of a Paris exhibit of 1925, the Exposition Internationale des Arts 
Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes. Art Deco style is characterized by slender forms, straight lines,

Assonance  The repetition of vowel sounds in a literary work, especially in a poem. Edgar  Allen Poe&#x27;s &quot;The 
Bells&quot; contains numerous examples: Hear the mellow wedding bells . . . and From the molten -
golden notes . . . The repetition of the short &#x27;e&#x27; and long &#x27;o&#x27; sounds denotes a heavier, more serious 
bell than the bell encountered in the first stanza where the assonance included the &#x27;i&#x27; sound in

to refer to church buildings and a specific form.  
Bathos  Writing is bathetic when it strives to be serious (impassioned or elevated) but achieves only a comic 
effect because it is anti -climactic. &quot;Anticlimax&quot; is synonymous with bombast but can also refer to a 
bathetic effect which is intentional. In Tom Thumb the Great (1731), Fielding uses anticlimax for 
the purposes of satire, as when King Arthur observes the signs of love in his daughter: &quot;Your eyes 
spit fire, your cheeks grow red as beef.&quot; Here figurative language that begins with an ennobling 
(though bombastic) fire  metaphor then descends to the mean level of raw steak.
