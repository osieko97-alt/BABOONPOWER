Description:  
This unit is designed to provide pre -service teachers with knowledge and understanding of diversity and 
inclusive frameworks for addressing the diverse learning needs of individuals. Pre -service teachers will 
investigate theoretical perspectives, and inter national, national and state policies and legislation to 
understand and implement specific inclusive teaching strategies for all students including students with 
disabilities, behaviour disorders and difficulties in learning, and stude nts from Aboriginal a nd Torres Strait 
Islander or non -English speaking backgrounds, and students with gifted and talented abilities. The aim of

GRADUATE ATTRIBUTES  
Each unit in your program contributes in some way to the development of the ACU Graduate Attributes 
which you should demonstrate by the time you complete your cours e. You can view the ACU Graduate 
Attributes for all courses at http://www.acu.edu.au/204356 . All Australian universities have their expected 
graduate attributes – ACU’s Graduate Attributes have a greater emphasis on ethical behaviour and 
community responsibility than those of many other universities. All of your units will enable you to 
develop Gr aduate Attributes.  
On successful completion of this unit, you should have developed your ability to:  
GA1 demonstrate respect for the dignity of each individual and for  human diversity 
GA3 apply ethical perspectives in informed decision  making  
GA5 demonstrate values, knowledge, skills and attitudes appropriate to the  discipline  and/or 
profession  
GA7 work both autonomously and  collaboratively.  
 
 
CATHOLIC SOCIAL TEACHING  
 
The School of Education (QLD) has embarked on an initiative to bring ACU’s Missi on

of Catholic Social Teaching ( http://www.caritas.org.au/learn/catholic -social -teaching ) in units such as this 
one. 
For 2019 the Catholic Social Teachings that will be emphasised are “Subsidiarity (and Participation)” and
