ENGLISH TENSES – OVERVIEW
ENGLISH TENSES – OVERVIEW
While
discussing
English
tenses,
as
well
as
those
in
any
other
language,
it
is
extremely
important
to
explain
the
relations
between
TIME
and
TENSE,
as
well
as
to
emphasize
the
crucial
difference
between
the
two
concepts:
the
one
of
time
(
extra
linguistic
),
and
the
strictly
linguistic one – the concept of 
tense
.
Time,
being
an
extra
linguistic
concept,
and
existing
independently
in
the
universe,
encompasses
three,
more
or
less
distinct,
segments
or
categories:
past
,
present
and
future
.
On
the
other
hand,
the
tenses
are
considered
to
be
a
strictly
linguistic
concept,
i.e.
verb
forms
used to express actions, events, or states occurring in time.
This
becomes
particularly
important
in
view
of
the
fact
that
in
English,
as
indeed
is
the
case
with
some
other
languages,
there
is
no
strict
or
unambiguous
correspondence
between
time
and
tense:
a
present
tense
may
be
used
to
express
actions
happening
in
the
future
and
past
time.
The Simple Present Tense
Form:
The
Simple
Present
Tense,
as
its
name
clearly
implies,
is
formed
of
only
one
element,
i.e.
of
the
base
form
of
the
verb,
with
the
addition
of
the
ending
–s
or
inflectional
suffix
(following
a
vowel) or 
–es 
(following a consonant)
 
in the third person singular.
In
order
to
express
the
negative
form,
a
special
auxiliary
verb
do
is
used:
does
not
/
doesn’t
for
third person singular and 
do not / don’t 
for the remaining persons, either singular or plural.
As
far
as
the
interrogative
form
is
concerned,
the
same
verb
forms
of
do
are
used
(i.e.
the
auxiliary
verb
do
functioning
as
the
operator)
,
following
the
word
order
of
to
do
+
subject
+
main verb
 (inversion of the verb).

ENGLISH TENSES
Use:
The most common use of the tense is to express the present state of affairs or a general fact.
present state: 
He 
likes
 sailing.
general fact: 
The water 
boils
 at 100 degrees Celsius.
                    Zagreb 
lies 
on the River Sava.
Another
typical
usage
of
the
Present
Simple
concerns
routines
and
habits,
things
that
occur
repeatedly.
Time
expressions
used
relating
to
this
particular
usage
are
often,
seldom,
always,
usually,
frequently,
sometimes,
every
day/week/month/year;
ever
(never),
etc.,
sometimes
also
referred to as 
adverbs of frequency
:
He always
 drives
 to work.
The Present Progressive / Continuous Tense
Form:
The
Present
Continuous
(or
Progressive)
relates
to
the
imperfective
aspect
and
is
complex
in
its
essence,
i.e.
formed
of
two
elements:
the
present
tense
of
the
verb
to
be
+
-ing
form
(the
present participle of the main verb).
Use:
The
main
uses
relate
to
the
present
action
that
is
in
progress
in
the
immediate
present,
the
so-called
instantaneous
present.
Typical
time
expressions
are
thus:
now,
at
the
moment,
still,
just, 
etc:
The train 
is leaving 
the Victoria Station now.
The
action
does
not
need
to
be
in
progress
at
the
exact
moment
of
speaking:
it
can
be
occurring “around now”, i.e. it could have begun but is not completed yet:
I
am
reading
an
interesting
story
at
the
moment.
(i.e.
I
was
reading
it
yesterday,
I
have
not
finished yet, and I will continue reading it later).
Permanent vs. temporary
The
main
contrast
between
the
two
tenses
discussed
above
concerns
the
difference
between
permanent routines (Present Simple) and temporary routines (Present Continuous):
He
travels
to
work
by
car
(permanent),
but
his
car
has
broken
down,
so
he
is
travelling
to
work by train this week. 
(temporary)
Expressing annoyance

ENGLISH TENSES
The
Present
Progressive
can
be
used
in
order
to
express
annoyance
or
irritation
on
the
part
of
the speaker concerning someone’s behaviour. The time expression 
always 
is typically added:
He 
is 
always 
arriving 
late.
Future time
Both
Present
Simple
and
Progressive
can
refer
to
the
future
time.
The
Present
Simple
verb
form
can
thus
express
an
action
that
has
been
arranged
and
is
due
to
happen
because
of
the
fixed schedule or timetable:
The train 
leaves 
for London at 11 o’clock this evening.
Meanwhile,
the
Present
Progressive
expresses
an
action
that
will
occur
because
of
the
arrangements among people, i.e. expresses personal plans:
Ann
is
eating
at
the
restaurant
with
her
husband
this
evening.
(They
have
previously
arranged
to do so.)
Historical present
Although
past
actions
are
usually
narrated
using
the
past
verb
forms,
present
tenses
(both
simple
and
progressive)
are
sometimes
used
in
order
to
make
the
action
or
the
story
plot
more
immediate and more vivid to the listener or reader:
Macbeth 
murders 
the King of Scotland, who 
is staying 
at his castle.
Instantaneous present
Present
Simple
Tense
typically
occurs
in
the
sports
commentaries
in
order
to
express
action
as
it actually happens:
Hacker 
passes 
the ball to Short, but Burley 
wins 
it back for United.
The Past Simple Tense
Form:
The
tense
is
formed
by
either
adding
the
–d
or
–ed
to
the
base
form
if
the
verb
is
regular,
or
using
the
special
forms
if
it
is
irregular
(e.g.
write-
wrote
,
see-
saw
,
take-
took
,
hurt-
hurt
).
It
may
be
noted
that,
with
the
Simple
Present
Tense,
it
is
the
only
simple
tense
in
English,
all
the
other
tenses
representing
complex
verb
phrases
formed,
apart
from
the
main
verb,
by
means
of primary and/or modal auxiliaries.
Negative
is
formed
by
means
of
the
irregular
past
form
of
the
auxiliary
verb
to
do
(
did
not
or
didn’t),
regardless
of
the
person
or
number,
while
the
past
form
changes
into
the
base
form
of
the main verb:

ENGLISH TENSES
I 
saw
 her at the party but I 
didn’t 
speak
 to her.
Interrogative
is
formed
by
using
the
past
tense
of
the
auxiliary
verb
to
do
as
the
operator
(always preceding the subject), and the word order is as follows:
did + subject + the base verb form, 
i.e. without the past ending.
Did
 you 
speak
 to her at the party last night?
Use:
The
basic
use
of
the
Past
Simple
involves
the
action
started
and
completed
in
the
past,
i.e.
definite past actions.
The
typical
time
expressions
yesterday;
last
week/
month/year
or
in
the
particular
year
indeed
specify the time and indicate the completeness of the action expressed:
I 
bought 
this interestingCD yesterday.
The earthquake 
happened 
in the 1905.
The
Past
Simple
may
be
used
to
refer
to
states
existing
in
the
past,
in
which
case
stative
verb
forms are used:
The Romans 
had 
a huge Empire.
She 
was 
a beautiful girl indeed.
The tense is typically used in retelling stories, i.e. in narrating past events:
Once upon a time a Princess 
went 
into a wood and 
sat 
down
 
by a stream.
It
is
important
to
emphasize
that,
unlike
Croatian
that
uses
imperfective
verb
forms
for
past
habits, English uses Past Simple verb forms instead:
He often
 went
 to rock concerts..
         vs.
Često 
je odlazio 
na rock koncerte
. 
.
Sequence of tenses / Reported speech
Another
important
use
of
the
Past
Simple
and
Progressive
verb
forms
occurs
in
the
dependent
clause
of
reported
speech,
providing
that
the
so-called
introductory
or
reporting
verb
is
in
a
past
tense
(Past
Simple,
Continuous,
or
Past
Perfect).
In
the
described
situation
it
expresses
simultaneousness in the past:
Peter told me what the matter 
was.

ENGLISH TENSES
He told me he 
was leaving.
2
nd
 type conditional clause
The
Past
Simple
verb
forms
regularly
appear
in
the
dependent
or
so-called
if-
clause
of
the
2
nd
type
conditional
sentences,
where
it
actually
represents
an
unreal
condition
in
the
present,
functioning as the present subjunctive:
If I 
were 
you, I would ask him what the matter is.
If I 
had 
lots of money, I would travel round the world.
I would tell you the answer if I 
knew 
what it was.
Unreal wish for the present
Past
Simple
verb
forms
occur
in
the
sentences
beginning
with
If
only,
I
wish,
etc.,
representing
present wishes not likely to be fulfilled. The forms are also called subjunctive verb forms:
If only I 
saw 
her now!
I wish you 
weren’t 
so rude.
Other conjunctions that require such a subjunctive form are 
as if, as though, suppose…, etc.:
She looks as if she 
were 
excited.
In
all
of
the
above
examples,
the
past
verb
forms
somehow
signify
distance
from
the
speaker’s
reality.
The Present Perfect Simple Tense
Form:
The
tense
is
formed
using
two
elements:
the
present
form
of
the
auxiliary
to
have
(have
or
has
for
the
third
person
singular)
and
the
past
participle
form
of
the
main
verb.
The
verb
can
be
either
regular,
thus
having
its
past
participle
and
past
tense
forms
identical,
or
irregular,
its
past participle form being unique.
The
interrogative
form
is
obtained
by
the
inversion
of
the
two
elements,
inserting
the
subject
in
the
middle.
The
important
thing
to
notice
is
that
the
verb
remains
in
its
participle
form,
unlike the Past Simple Tense where the base form of the verb is used.
In
order
to
form
the
negative,
the
negative
form
of
the
auxiliary
is
to
be
used:
either
have
not
/
haven’t 
or 
has not 
or 
hasn’t 
(third person singular).
