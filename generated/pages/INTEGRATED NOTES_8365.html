PROPERTIES OF MATTER  
Matter is anything that has weight and occupies space. Everything found around us is matter  
♣ Properties of Solids:  
1) Solid has a fixed shape and a fixed volume.  
2) Solid cannot be compressed.  
3) Solids have a high density.  
4) Force of attraction between the particles in a solid is very strong.  
5) The space between the particles of solids is negligible.

Summary  
 
 
Diffusion  in liquids  
Diffusion is movement of molecules from a region of high concentration to a 
region of low concentration  
When the crystals of potassium permanganate are kept in water,  the 
purple -coloured crystals of potassium permanganate break further into 
smaller particles that occupy the space between the molecules of water 
imparting a purple colour t o the water . So this is an example of diffusion

Beaker containing potassium permanganate (purple) and water, and a clock being used 
to time how long it takes for the purple colour to spread through the water as the 
potassium permanganate dissolves.  
 
This apparatus is used to demonstrate diffusion in a liquid. Eventually, the random 
motion of all the potassium permanganate particles results in the purple colour being 
equally dispersed throughout the water. The process appears slow as the dissolved 
particles collide with the water molecules and each other , slowing their progress.  
 
 
 
 


Changes of state of matter  
A change of state is a physical change in a matter. They are reversible changes and do 
not involve any changes in the chemical makeup of the matter. Common changes of 
the state include  melting, freezing, sublimation, deposition, condensation, and 
vaporization .  
 
 
Why matter states changes  
It is possible that we have seen changes in the state of matter as the ice cubes melt into 
liquid water, or when the water boils and turns into vapour but have  we ever thought 
about the reason behind this?  
The changing states of matter occur as the matter absorbs or loses  energy . When an 
object absorbs energy, molecules and atoms accelerate their movement and t his 
increased energy kinetics can push particles so that they alter their state. The energy 
that is absorbed is typically  thermal  or heat e nergy.   
 
Changing States of Matter  
There are generally three types of matter: liquid, solid, and gas. In the solid state, the 
particles or  molecules  are tightly together which is why they possess an intense 


intermolecular force of attraction. The liquid states of particles, however, are apart 
from one another and thus have less force to attract them. In the case of gas, the 
particles are extremely far  from one another and exhibit a negligible force of 
attraction.  
If there are changes in the temperature or pressure of a material, the change of  states 
of matter  takes place. The state of matter can be changed by changing temperature and 
pressure. The impact of temperature changes on states of matter shifting will be 
directly related to changes in the interaction between molecules that make up the 
substance. If the temperature drops, particles can soften into a robust structure.  
The diagram below depicts the change of states of matter through different types of 
processes taking place in those states:  
 
Here to understand this phenomenon we can take an  example of the conversion of ice 
into water. In this conversion, the ice which is a solid form of water gets changed into 
water which is the liquid form itself. This change in the state occurs due to a process 
known as melting, and in this process, when k ept at a higher temperature the solid ice 
gets converted into liquid water. In melting, mainly the liquefaction of ice takes place.  
From this example, we can understand that the change of states of matter can only 
occur through a certain process that takes  place due to a rise or fall in its temperature 
or due to an increase or decrease in its pressure. Without these things, nothing can 
change the state of a matter. There are many processes similar to melting which are 
responsible for changing the state of a  particular matter.  
Changes Between Liquids and Solids  
We have seen that changes of state take place and the compound changes from one 
physical form to another. One such change is between liquids and solids. To 


understand this we can take an example of rock which gets converted into lava when 
exposed to extreme heat and pressure but when it cools down the lava again 
converts back into a rock.  
Freezing  
Freezing is the process in which the liquid converts into solid. To understand this we 
can take an examp le liquids getting converted into crystals. There are many liquids 
which do convert into solid but they do not take the exact solid form rather they 
converts themselves into tiny crystals.  
Melting  
Melting is a process in which the solid converts into liqui d by getting exposed to 
heat and  pressure . We can understand this from the example of metal converting 
into molten liquids by artisans to give them different kinds of shapes.  
Changes Between Liquids &amp; G ases 
Another change that takes place between different types of states is that between 
liquids and gases. In this change the liquids gets converted into gases or the gases 
into liquids and this mainly occurs by two process. An example to understand this is  
liquid water getting converting into water vapours which is the gaseous form of 
water and then the water vapour getting converted back into liquid water.  
Vaporization  
Vaporization  is the process in which the liquid gets converter into its gaseous form. 
For example, if we take some water in a saucepan and heat it up then after some 
time the water will start to decrease in quantity. This thing happens with water as its 
gets converted into steam by the presence of heat and pressure on it.  
Condensation  
The conversion of gases into liquids takes  place by the process of  condensation . In 
this the water vapour which is present in the atmosphere into droplets of dew on 
grass and trees when temperature is lo w and pressure is also low.  
 
Changes between  Solids &amp; Gases  
One more change that take place is the solid state of matter changing into gaseous 
phase and then the gaseous state into the solid state. It can be understood by the 

example of freeze drying of wa ter in which it gets converted from solid to gaseous in 
normal temperature and pressure and when the temperature and pressure is lowered 
it goes back to its solid form.  
Sublimation  
Sublimation  is a process in which the solid state of matter converts directly into the 
gaseous state and the gaseous back into solid state without going through the liquid 
phase change. This process can be understood by taking the example of dry ice. Dry 
ice converts from  solid to gas in normal temperature and pressure but when the 
temperature is lowered and the pressure is decreased it converts back to its solid 
form.  
Deposition  
Deposition is a phase change where gas becomes a solid without going through the 
liquid phase.  
The forces of attraction between the solids are completely eliminated when they 
have absorbed enough energy. A deposition is the inverse of Sublimation and vice 
versa.  
The most typical example of deposition is frost, which is the deposition of water 
vapou r from humid air which converts into a solid ice.  
Examples of Change of State of Matter in Everyday Life  
There are several examples of changes of state of matter that occur in everyday life. 
Here are a few common examples:  
o Ice melting:  When ice at 0°C is heated, it changes from solid state to liquid state and 
starts melting.  
o Frost formation:  When the temperature drops below 0°C, water vapour in the air 
condenses directly into solid ice crystals.  
o Water boiling:  When water is heated, it c hanges from liquid state to gas state 
(steam).  
o Condensation of water vapour:  When water vapour in the air cools below 100°C, it 
changes from gas state to liquid state and condenses to form liquid water droplets.  
o Sublimation:  An example of sublimation is wh en solid dry ice (frozen carbon dioxide) 
changes into carbon dioxide gas without melting.  
  
Causes and Effects of Changing States of Matter  
The main cause of change in states of matter is due to the addition or loss of energy in the 
state of a substance th at is altered physically.  

This phenomenon is connected with the movement of molecules. Solids possess very 
little kinetic energy , meaning that they only vibrate and keep the bonds of chemical stre ngth. 
If the energy source is placed in (e.g. heat energy, which can later be converted into kinetic 
energy) then the molecules begin spinning and vibrating faster, which causes the strength of 
the bonds to diminish.  
If a certain amount of heating is appli ed (this is different for each substance, for example, the 
melting point of the water is 0°C while the boiling point is 100°C) those molecules will be 
moving towards the point of not remaining </pre>
