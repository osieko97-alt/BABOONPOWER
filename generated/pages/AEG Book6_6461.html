The preparatory Itis used to show opinion or condition (especially concerning time, distance, and

There was a new girl at school today.There were two groups of pterosaurs, or flying
reptiles. The early pterosaurs, which went extinctat the end of the Jurassic Period, came first.Descendants of the first group, the second groupdeveloped in the late Jurassic. Itis believed that
this group included the largest flying reptiles ever. 
Up to fifteen meters from wingtip to wingtip,
the largest pterosaur was Quetzalcoatlus . Itis
thought to have weighed up to 100 kilograms. Its neck was extremely long, its jawslacked teeth, and its head featured a long, bony crest. 
There are still questions about how this amazing animal lived. Itis thought to
have soared high in the sky, covering great distances. This ability, along with its longneck, has prompted the idea that it survived in a similar way to the vulture, feedingon the corpses of dead dinosaurs. However, because of its long slender jaws, ithas
also been suggested that Quetzalcoatlus searched tidal pools and shores for shellfish
and other sea animals. Ithas also been hypothesized that it flew low over warm 
shallow seas, plucking fish from the surface of the water.

Part A 9Grammar in Use
Exercise 6 Read the passage and underline all the uses of preparatory itand
preparatory there .
There have been large extinctions
throughout Earth’s history. The mostfamous of these signaled the end of thedinosaurs about 65 million years ago. Itis important to note that not just thedinosaurs died out in this extinction.Around 70 percent of all the species onEarth died out at that time. Althoughdinosaurs had been in a period of decline before the extinction, it is thought that arecovery would have occurred if something catastrophic had not prevented it.
The most accepted theory about the cause of this extinction is the asteroid 
theory. It is believed that an asteroid about 10 km in diameter hit the Earth. It is
suggested that the impact from such a collision would have destroyed everything
within about 500 km of the impact site. It would also have caused fires, increased volcanic activity, and sent huge clouds of dust gases and water vapor into theatmosphere. Because of this, there would have been months of darkness, coolertemperatures, and acid rain. It is interesting to note that there is a crater about180 km in diameter off the northwest tip of the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico. Thecrater has been dated as 65 million years old and is believed to be evidence of ahuge asteroid impact.
