Grammar is a very old field of study. Did you know that 
the sentence was first divided into subject and verb by 
Plato, the famed philosopher from ancient Greece? That 
was about 2,400 years ago! Ever since then, students all 
over the world have found it worthwhile to study the 
structure of words and sentences. Why? Because skill in 
speaking and writing is the hallmark of all educated 
people.
Lesson by lesson, this book provides basic instruction 
in the eight parts of speech—nouns, pronouns, verbs, 
adjectives, adverbs, prepositions, conjunctions, and 
interjections—as well as the standard patterns of English 
sentences.
All students of English, be they native speakers or those 
who are studying English as a second language, will 
profit from the fundamental introduction and review of 
grammar provided by SADDLEBACK&#x27;S BASIC ENGLISH 
GRAMMAR 1 and 2. Helpful marginal notes throughout 
the books have been provided to reinforce existing skills 
and call attention to common problem areas.
We wish you every success in your pursuit of English 
proficiency.Note to the Student
