guarantee your (own) safety.   
Personal protective equipment  (PPE ) is protective  clothing , helmets , goggles , or 
other garments or equipment designed to protect the wearer&#x27;s body 
from  injury  or infection . The hazards addressed by protective equipment include 
physical, electrical, heat, chemicals,  biohazards , and  harmful  gases.  


 
 
Face  and Eye Protection  
PPE includes safety goggles and face shields and should be used for tasks that can 
cause eye damage or loss of vision, sprays of toxic liquids, splashes, and burns.  
Safety  Tips:  
 Check if safety glasses  
 Ensure that there are no cracks or deformities on the lenses.  
 Ensure the strap is in good working condition and is firmly  sealed to the cheek and 
forehead.  
 Clean and disinfect after use.  


 
Respiratory Protection  
PPE includes full -face respirators, self -contained breathing apparatus, gas masks, 
N95 respirators, and surgical masks are used for a task that can cause inhalation of 
harmful materials to enter the body. This includes harmful gas, chemicals, large -
particle droplets, sprays, splashes, or splatter that may contain viruses and bacteria 
such as COVID -19, viral infections, and more.  
Safety  Tips:  
 Ensure that the equipment is fit-tested and the employee has undergone proper 
training before wearing one.  
 Carefully read the instructions to determine if it is designed to help protect against 
the hazards you may face.  
 Change filters on half -mask or full -mask respirators frequentl y. 
 Replace disposable respirators with every use.  
 Surgical masks are not to be shared with anyone.  
 Avoid touching the surgical mask after wearing it.  
 Change surgical mask timely and should be disposed of after use.

Skin and Body Protection  
PPE includes the following categories to protect employees from physical hazards:  
Head  Protection  
  
 
PPE includes hard hats and headgears and should be required for tasks that can 
cause any force or object falling to the head.  
Safety  Tips:  
 Ensure that there are no dents or deformities on the shell and connections are 
tightened inside.  


 Do not store in direct sunlight as extreme heat  can cause damage.  
 Choose appropriate cleaning agents as it can weaken the shells of hard hats and 
may eliminate  electrical  resistance.  
 Always replace a hard hat if it was used for any kind of impact, even if the damage 
is unnoticeable.  
Body Protection  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
PPE includes safety vests and suits that can be used for tasks that can cause body

temperature  hazards.  
Hands Protection  
PPE includes safety gloves and should be used for tasks that can cause hand and 
skin burns, absorption of harmful s ubstances, cuts, fractures or amputations.  


 
 
Safety  Tips:  
 Ensure hand protection fits perfectly with no spaces and is free from cuts, burns, 
and chemical residue.  
 Always replace them if any sign of contamination was observed.  
 Use rubber gloves when working with heat and electricity to reduce the risk of 
burn or  electrical  shock.  
Foot Protection  
PPE includes knee pads and safety boots and should be used for tasks that can 
cause serious foot and leg injuries from falling or rolling objects, hot 
substances,  electrical  hazards , and slippery surfaces.  
 
 
 
 
Safety  Tips:

Important  safety rules in the workplace  
Here are examples of safety rules in a workplace:  
1. Follow the dress code  
It is important to dress according to the workplace dress code. This may prohibit 
jewelry or open -toe shoes, for example.  Often a workplace may require employees 
to wear specific footwear and long sleeves and pants in order to protect against 
common workplace accidents. Dress codes can promote professionalism and also 
help keep employees safe.  
2. Wear safety gear  
Safety gear  is necessary in labs, around machinery and on construction sites, for 
example. Companies include safety gear in the dress code when it is necessary for 
your job. Safety gear is a precaution against hazardous materials and potentiall y 
dangerous working con ditions.  
 
3. Maintain personal hygiene  

Maintain your personal hygiene, such as cleanliness, to help prevent illness at 
work. Good hygiene can also help promote health and self -esteem, which reduces 
risks.  
4. Take responsibility for your personal safety  
To take responsibility for your personal safety means ensuring that you follow 
safety procedures. If employees rely on themselves to keep the workplace safe, this 
can create a safe environment for all. Responsibility also prevents negligence, 
which can limit on-the-job accidents.  
5. Maintain a clean workspace  
It is important to keep your desk or other personal workspaces clean. Be sure to put 
away supplies when they are not in use. Gathering necessary materials before 
starting a task can help keep a clean work space. Maintaining your work area 
promotes organization and attentiveness, both aspects of promoting safety in the 
workplace.  
6. Follow work procedures  
A company creates work  procedures  to help comply with safety protocols and best 
practices, so if you follow work procedures, safety standards are likely met. It is 
important to fo llow procedures even if you think performing a task differently 
might save time. Often there&#x27;ll be an employee handbook or safety station where 
the company provides their work procedures.  
7. Learn how to act in an emergency  
Learn emergency protocols includ ing where to go in case of a fire or during a 
natural disaster such as a tornado. Much like work procedures, companies design 
emergency protocols with strong consideration for safety regulations. Knowing 
where to go or how to behave during an emergency pro tects you as well as your 
coworkers.  
 
8. Report accidents if they occur  

Report accidents to the managers or other personnel when they occur. If you injure 
yourself or cause an accident, be sure to report it and follow procedure 
immediately to help reduce t he risks of further harm or endangering coworkers. 
This helps to get proper treatment for your injury and addresses the possible causes 
of the incident to prevent it from happening again. It is important to follow 
company policy and report even minor incid ents. Your employer may require a 
written report of the incident as well.  
9. Report unsafe conditions  
If you observe an unsafe practice or condition such as faulty equipment, it is 
helpful to report this so that personnel can address the situation and make  
corrections to prevent an incident. Unsafe conditions pose a threat to your 
coworkers and to you, so reporting a potentially dangerous situation is in the best 
interest of all employees. Consider marking any unsafe condition to protect others 
who may enco unter it while you go to report it.  
10. Lift objects carefully  
Professionals advise lifting by squatting and using your knees when picking items 
up instead of bending at your waist because this can cause strain on your back and 
may result in injury. Use equipment if necessary or ask for help in lifting heavy 
items. Back pain is a common workplace injury that you can avoid with proper 
posture and using caution in actions that you often repeat at work, such as carrying 
materials.  
11. Operate machinery that you are familiar with
