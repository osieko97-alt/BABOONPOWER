Verb Moods: Indicative and Imperative
The indicative mood is the most common verb mood in English. It is used to express facts and opinions,
or to ask questions about them. The indicative mood is used in all verb tenses.
The imperative mood is used to make requests or give orders and warnings. It is used only in the 
simple present and future tenses.I am going to visit Paris next week.
You looked happy yesterday.
My dog is barking at passing cars.
Does she have my book?
Do they study English on Tuesdays?
The subject in the imperative mood is always
you. In simple present tense, the you-subject is
not usually stated.
In the simple future tense, the you-subject is
usually stated. It is used to place strongeremphasis on a command.Pass me the salt, please.
Don’t walk near my vegetable garden.
Look out for those bees!
