Types of computer

--- Slide 3 ---
Analog computer
Analog computer measures and answer the questions by the method of “HOW MUCH”. The input data is not a number infect a physical quantity like temp, pressure, speed, velocity.
Signals are continuous of (0 to 10 V)
Accuracy 1% Approximately
High speed
Output is continuous
Time is wasted in transmission time

Analog computer

--- Slide 5 ---
Digital Computers
Digital computer counts and answer the questions by the method of “HOW Many”. The input data is represented by a number. These are used for the logical and arithmetic operations.
Signals are two level of (0 V or 5 V)
Accuracy unlimited
low speed sequential as well as parallel processing
Output is continuous but obtain when computation is completed.
