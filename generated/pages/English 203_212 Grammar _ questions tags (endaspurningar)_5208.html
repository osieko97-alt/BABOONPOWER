<pre>questions tags ( endaspurningar ) 
 
Examples:   
• You’re not hungry, are you?  
• They’ve already done the washing up, haven’t they?  
• Be quiet, will you?  
 
USE: Questions like the underlined ones above are used either to invite agreement (with falling 
intonation), or to ask for confirma tion of facts (falling intonation). 
 
 
Examples: It’s lovely today, isn’t it?  ( Don’t you agree? ) 
 1 
 
You didn’t tell her our secret, did you? ( Can you confirm/verify?) 
 
Form:  Question tags consist of an auxiliary verb (do, does, is, are, have, ha s, must, can, etc.) and a 
personal pronoun (he, she, it, we, they, you, etc.)  There are a few basic rules: 
 
• If there’s an auxiliary (do/does, be, have) or modal auxiliary verb  (can, must, need, etc.) in the 
main clause, this is repeated in the question tag. 
Examples:  Katla isn’t  coming, is she?  Jóhann will be furious, won’t he? 
• If there is an ordinary verb in the main clause, do is  used in the question tag. 
Examples:  Sam likes  (= does like ) bananas, doesn’t she? 
  They went  (= did go) to Russia last year, didn’t they? 
  He had ( = did have)  an accident a week ago, didn’t he? 
• Normally an affirmative statement ha s a negative question, and vice versa: 
 
Statement Question tag  
affirmative  negative You’re coming, aren’t you  
negative   affirmative He doesn’t like heavy metal music, does he?

i) You hadn’t been to an opera before,  9. have you? 
j) You’ve got some time to spare,  10. did you? 
 
Special points 
• I am  is followed by the question tag aren’t I?  (I’m lucky, aren’t I?) 
• After an imperative (boðháttur), will you?  Or would you?  Are the most common forms. Use will 
you?  After a negative imperative: 
Example: Pay attention, will you?   Shut the door, would you? 
But Don’t be late, will you?  (not would you? ) 
• Negative expressions like no, nothi ng, nowhere, and nobody in the main clause are followed by an 
affirmative question tag. 

 2Example : She takes no interest in her studies, does she? 
• Somebody/someone, everybody/everyone  and nobody/no-one  are followed by they in a question 
tag.  For example: 
Nobody called for me, did they? 
Everyone was very pleased, weren’t they? 
• Sentences beginning with the directive let’s, we use  shall we? 
• Nothing/anything  in the main clause is followed by it in a question tag.  For example: 
Nothing could be better, could it? 
Anything could happen now, couldn’t it?
