Soil
Dirt is simply misplaced soil!

--- Slide 2 ---
SOIL: A RENEWABLE RESOURCE
Soil is a slowly renewed resource that provides most of the nutrients needed for plant growth and also helps purify water.
Soil formation begins when bedrock is broken down by physical, chemical and biological processes called weathering.
Mature soils have developed over a long time are arranged in a series of horizontal layers,soil horizons.

Layers in Mature Soils
Infiltration: the downward movement of water through soil.
Leaching: dissolving of minerals and organic matter in upper layers carrying them to lower layers.
The soil type determines the degree of infiltration and leaching.

SOIL: Horizons

Soil Profiles

--- Slide 7 ---
Soil Horizons
O horizon:  leaf litter
A horizon:  top soil
E horizon:  eluviation zone; 
eluviation is the lateral or downward movement of dissolved or suspended material within soil when rainfall exceeds evaporation, a.k.a. infiltration.  
A &amp; E horizons comprise the “zone of leaching” 
B horizon:  subsoil
C horizon:  parent material
Bedrock

Soil Color

--- Slide 14 ---
All Soil is Brown, Right?
Wrong! Soils vary in color depending on material make-up and location. 
The Munsell System of Color Notation is a color catalog.
Soil scientists compare the soil next to the color chips to find a visual match and assign the corresponding Munsell notation with the soil.
The wide use and acceptance of the Munsell System allows for direct comparison of soils anywhere in the world. 



--- Slide 15 ---
The Munsell system
The system categorizes by three components: hue, value, and chroma.

Hue: the specific color
Value: the lightness or darkness of color
Chroma: the light intensity

Color Chip Comparison

Soil Color Factors
Parent Material:  Minerals relate to color
Age/Time: Older soil is often more red
Climate: May leach, remove coatings, or even enhance red
Topography: Uplands are more brown and red; low lands are more grey.
Vegetation : Conifers are more acid, more leaching, less color and Grasslands are more organic, darker colors

--- Slide 21 ---
Diversity of Color
All soil in a specific area is not all the same color. 
Soil within the same soil profile can have strong color variation. 

--- Slide 22 ---
What do the colors indicate?  
Reddish, yellowish, or brownish: Iron oxides (variation from amount of:moisture) 
Hematite – red
Goethite – yellowish brown
Ferrihydrite – reddish brown
White: Carbonates, gypsum, other salts, or very leached 
Black/very dark brown: Organic matter
Purple/black: Manganese oxides

Considered a basic property because it doesn’t change

Soil Separates
Most soils have a combination of soil particles sizes  
Sand
Silt
Clay

--- Slide 38 ---
Soil Particles
Soils vary in the size of the particles they contain, the amount of space between these particles, and how rapidly water flows through them.

Texture by Feel 

--- Slide 44 ---
Fine Textured Soil
Large amounts of silt and clay, making it &quot;muddy&quot; when wet  
Pore spaces are small, but numerous and hold more water
As clay soils begin to dry, they may still hold large quantities of water, but adhesive and cohesive properties of water make it unavailable for root uptake 


--- Slide 45 ---
Fine Textured Soil

--- Slide 46 ---
Coarse Textured Soil
Large pore spaces and allows water to easily run through it beyond the reach of roots
Drought-prone
Little surface area for the particle volume, reducing fertility

General Influence of Soil Separates on Properties and Behaviors of Soils

--- Slide 51 ---
Soil Texture and Surface Area
As particle size decreases, surface area increases
Clay has about 10,000 times as much surface area as sand
Surface area has a big effect on:
Water holding capacity
Chemical reactions
Soil cohesion
Ability to support microorganisms

--- Slide 52 ---
Influences of Soil Properties
Organic Matter is derived from decomposing plant and animal remains 
Humus is the dark, moist layer found on the top of a soil profile. This is because it is made up of dead and decaying matter. It is fairly fertile in that the decay process adds nutrients to the soil that plants love to soak up

--- Slide 53 ---
Influences of Soil Properties
Parent Material:
Rock or original source of soil particles 
Effects soil quality
Glacial outwash sands tend to be infertile, or hold few minerals and nutrients important for growth  
Soils derived from other sources may be relatively rich in minerals and nutrients 
Usually a combination of weathered parent materials and organic matter make a soil

--- Slide 54 ---
Sources of Parent Material 
Weathering or erosive actions:
heating/cooling
freezing/thawing
glaciers
water
wind
chemistry
plants &amp; animals

--- Slide 55 ---
Other Uses of Soil
Native North American cultures used earth colors as body paints.
Modern American culture uses colored earth in cosmetics and ceramics and as pigments for paints.

--- Slide 56 ---
Porosity and Permeability

--- Slide 57 ---
Porosity
A measure of the amount of pore space between grains; the ratio of the volume of openings (voids) to the total volume of material.  Porosity represents the storage capacity of geologic material

--- Slide 58 ---
Permeability
A measure of the ability for fluid to pass through the pores.

--- Slide 59 ---
Wetlands- rich in humus and nutrients
Hydrology, Soil type, Species composition

--- Slide 60 ---
Pond
Littoral zone has soil where rooted plants live (water lillies, cattails)
Aides in reducing erosion

--- Slide 61 ---
Soil Nutrition

--- Slide 62 ---
Nutrients in Soil
Nutrients are chemical elements and compounds found in the environment that plants and animals need to grow and survive. 
Nitrate (NO3-), 
nitrite (NO2-), 
ammonia (NH3), 
organic nitrogen (in the form of plant material or other organic compounds), and 
phosphates (PO43-)(orthophosphate and others)

--- Slide 63 ---
MATTER CYCLING IN ECOSYSTEMS
Nutrient Cycles: Global Recycling
Global Cycles recycle nutrients through the earth’s air, land, water, and living organisms.
Nutrients are the elements and compounds that organisms need to live, grow, and reproduce.
Biogeochemical cycles move these substances through air, water, soil, rock and living organisms.

--- Slide 64 ---
The Big 13
The 13 mineral nutrients, which come from the soil, are dissolved in water and absorbed through a plant&#x27;s roots. There are not always enough of these nutrients in the soil for a plant to grow healthy. This is why many</pre>
