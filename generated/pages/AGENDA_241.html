  FUNCTIONAL WRITING NOTES  
FORM 1  
 
 
E-mail Address and access  
 
Pre-requisites   
 
i. A computer  
ii. A telephone line connected to the computer  
iii. An internal or external modem(an electronic device that changes information that a 
computer underst ands to a form that can be sent along a telephone line by radio and vice -
versa)  
 
-To get an e -mail address , you  need to be connected to an Internet Service Provider ( ISP) 
reffered to as the server.  
-Once connected, the ISP gives you a user name e.g k00395. This is an identification number 
which is used to identify a client and for billing purposes.  
-The client chooses a password which must be keyed in to be able to access the internet and its e -
mail.Onlu the client should know the password for privacy e.g 00 67, Rose, navyblue . 
 
Creating your own e -mail address  
-Every client must create his/her own e -mail address and reveal it to the ISP when you want to be 
connected.e.g  
i. robina@yahoo.com  
       1        2     3   4   5  
ii. kererahighschool@africaonline.go.ke  
                  1              2       3          4 5    6  
Key 
1. – User‟s chosen name.  
2. – Pronounced as „at‟ desginated the computer to the ISP  
3. – the ISP you are connected to.  

2 
  4. – the „dot‟ -is a must.If absent,the address is incomplete and the message can‟t go 
through the receiver.  
5. – shows the company type/school type.  
6. – name of country e.g ke -kenya.  
 
N/B.  
-An e -mail address is written continuously without space betw een words or letters.  It is written in 
small letters.  
 
International Servers  
-Some  e-mail address es like yahoo  and hotmail offer free services  
-To retrieve mail from such organizations,  you don‟t have to be connected to an ISP server.This 
can be done world wide provided that internet services are available.  
-The only disadvantage when using fr ee services is that you must wr ite your mail while you are  
“online” unlike other cases, where you can write your mail “off -line” and then connect to the 
server when you  wish to send the message.This is cheaper and saves you  the expense of a big 
bill. 
 
Sending an e -mail 
-To be able to send an e -mail,  you must  have the e -mail address of the recipient.  e.g 
 
To: You write the address of the recipient.  
From: You write the add ress of the sender  
Cc: meaning coupon copy - other people who can be sent copies of the same mail.  
Bc:  a blind copy to be seen by the recipient only.  
Subject:  you write the title of the message.  
-Below the subject is the space for your message.  
e.g. 
 
To:up agna@hotmail.com  
From : ericken@gmail.com  
Cc: rosina@yahoo.com
