Description:  
This unit is designed to critically evaluate the theory and practice of behaviour management in educational 
settings (primary or secondary). Schools and teachers need to be proa ctive in establishing a safe whole 
school context, supported by parent/carers and community stakeholders, to foster positive behaviour and 
manage challenging behaviour. As such, the major focus of this unit is the role of the classroom teacher, 
school admi nistration and parents/carers in developing and implementing appropriate curriculum and 
management principles related to behavioural management across the whole school.
