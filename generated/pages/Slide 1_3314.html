FEEDING DAIRY CATTLE
AG 310 - D


--- Slide 2 ---
I.	Terms and definitions
A.	Hay--Dry forage; 10%-25% moisture content
Silage--Fermented forage plants usually ensiled at 60%-67% moisture content
Haylage--Low moisture silage made from legumes and/or grasses; 35%-50% moisture content
High moisture grain--Grain containing between 24%-40% moisture and stored in an air-tight silo
Pre-mix--Feed purchased already combined in set amounts to provide a specified nutritional content
TDN--Total digestible nutrients
Carbohydrate--Nutrient supplying most of the energy needs for animals; usually easily digested and absorbed
Fiber--Carbohydrate with a digestibility of less than 50%
Lignin--Non-digestible portion of fiber that provides the &quot;bulk&quot; necessary for dairy animals
Protein--Nutrient made up of chains of amino acids which contain nitrogen; &quot;building blocks&quot; of muscles
Palatability--Flavor of the feed


--- Slide 3 ---
NE--Net energy or energy left in feeds after energy used in digestion has been subtracted
NElac--Net energy value used for maintenance and milk production in lactating cows
N.	Milk fat--Fat found in milk composed of short-chain fatty acids; contains vitamin A
O.	Colostrum--First &quot;milk&quot; of a cow after calving, high in nutrients and antibodies
P.	Antibody--Protein substance in the blood that protects against disease
Q.	Ketosis--Dairy disease caused by high milk production in which cow is forced to use body fat to supply production demands; this fat breakdown creates an oversupply of ketones
R.	Longevity--Length of time a cow remains in herd
S.	Lactating--Secreting milk
T.	Replacement heifers--Young females being raised to remain in the herd as cows
U.	Milk fever--A nutritional disease occurring at calving caused by a calcium-phosphorus imbalance

--- Slide 4 ---
II.	Nutritional areas of concern in balancing a dairy ration 
A.	Dry matter intake
B.	Crude protein
C.	TDN
D.	Calcium
E.	Phosphorus
F.	Fiber
G.	Trace mineral salt


--- Slide 5 ---
III.	Advantages of pastures for feed
A.	Lowers feed costs
B.	Lessens chance of nutritional deficiencies
C.	Lessens disease spread
D. Lowers building costs
E.	Increases flexibility
F.	Improves reproduction
G. Provides outlet for manure


--- Slide 6 ---
IV.	Disadvantages of pastures for feed
A.	Increases land requirements
B.	Limits expansion
C.	Does not provide enough dry matter and therefore energy to maintain high production
D.	Decreases feed efficiency
Cows must use more energy obtaining feed.
E.	Increases variability in production and growth
F.	Increases worm problems

--- Slide 7 ---
V.	Advantages of feeding hay

A.	Cut at an early maturity--1/10 bloom
B.	Leafy
C.	Bright green
D. Free from mold or dust
E.	Pleasant aroma


--- Slide 9 ---
VII.	Effects of poor hay quality on lactating cows
	A.	Lowers milk production
	B.	Lowers hay consumption
	C.	Increases grain requirements


--- Slide 10 ---
VIII.	Comparison of high quality hay and corn silage
Forty pounds of silage fed with 20 pounds of hay per day has proven to be a good balance for a dairy ration.
A.	Corn silage has 11% more TDN than hay on a dry matter basis
B.	Corn silage has a little over 1/4 the protein of alfalfa hay on a dry matter basis
C.	Feeding 3 pounds of corn silage is approximately equivalent to feeding 1 pound of hay on an as-fed basis
This is due to the much higher moisture content of silage figured at 70% in this case.

--- Slide 11 ---
IX.	Advantages of using silage
A.	Retains over 85% of crop feed value
B.	Allows maximum utilization of land in feed production
Corn can produce more TDN per acre as silage than any other crop.
C.	Can be harvested in relatively wet weather
This means it can also be harvested over a longer period without losing quality.
D.	Requires less storage space per pound of TDN than hay
E.	Improves utilization of by-products and other feeds with low palatability
F.	Can be stored with very little loss

--- Slide 12 ---
X.	Merits of corn versus grass silage
A.	Corn silage
1. Generally yields better
2. Easier to produce high quality silage consistently
3. More palatable
4. Higher in TDN
B.	Grass silage
1. Higher in protein
2. Can be produced in shorter and cooler growing seasons
3. Can be used for summer feeding by ensiling first cutting grass

--- Slide 13 ---
XI.	Types of silos 
A.	Tower
B.	Oxygen-limiting
C.	Pit
D.	Horizontal
bunker types which are above ground 
trench types which are below ground
E.	Temporary
These include stack type and plastic tubes.

--- Slide 14 ---
XII.	Most common grains for dairy cattle
A.	Corn
B.	Barley
This is the most common grain fed in Idaho and the western states and has about 90% of the TDN of corn.
C.	Oats
D.	Three-way mix--Wheat, barley and oats
This mixture has been used extensively in the Magic Valley area.

--- Slide 15 ---
XIII.	Most common protein supplements for dairy cattle in the western United States
A.	Soybean meal
B.	Cottonseed meal
C.	Whole soybean
D.	Whole cottonseed
Whole soybeans and cottonseeds supply oil and increase the energy level of the supplement.
E.	Alfalfa
Urea is a nitrogen source that ruminants can use to manufacture protein.  It can be used in limited quantities in dairy feed.

--- Slide 16 ---
XIV.	Reasons for taking precautions when feeding by-products
A.	Widely varying nutrient value
B.	Possible pesticide contaminations
C.	Possible low palatability
D.	Possible presence of toxic substances


--- Slide 17 ---
XV.	Feeding methods for minerals
A.	Free choice
B.	Mixed with ration


--- Slide 18 ---
XVI.	Most common minerals for dairy cattle
A.	Salt
A trace mineral salt is often used to insure an adequate supply of trace minerals.
B.	Calcium
C.	Phosphorus


--- Slide 19 ---
XVII.	Vitamin A
Vitamin A is most likely to be deficient in dairy cattle
A pre-mix can be helpful in preventing vitamin deficiencies since vitamins in feeds are easily destroyed.


--- Slide 20 ---
XVIII.	Necessary information for balancing rations
Ration formulation by computer is available through private companies and the universities, but the following information must still be available.
A. Feeds available
B. Nutrient values of feeds
C. Feed costs
D. Nutritional levels needed to meet production goals
E. Other requirements or limitations such as minimum fiber

--- Slide 21 ---
XIX.	Alternative ways to process grain
A.	Fine grinding
This method is generally not as satisfactory as it reduces palatability because of the powdery texture and dust.
B.	Coarse grinding
C.	Steam rolling
D.	Pelleting
This method increases consumption, but slightly lowers butterfat content.

--- Slide 22 ---
XX.	Effects of cubed and finely ground hay on dairy cattle
A.	Cubed hay--May increase production and does not affect butterfat content
B.	Finely ground and pelleted hay--Lowers fat content in milk; increases digestion problems

--- Slide 23 ---
XXI. Minimum requirements for roughage and fiber for a lactating cow
These amounts are necessary for proper digestive function.
A. 1 to 1 1/2 lbs of roughage per 100 lbs of body weight
B. 17% crude fiber


--- Slide 24 ---
XXII.	Rule of thumb
For determining concentrate levels to feed large dairy breeds--Feed 1 lb of grain for each 2 lbs of milk above a base of 20-30 lbs of milk
Jerseys and Guernseys should have 1 lb of grain for each 1 1/2 lbs of milk above a base of 15-20 lbs.


--- Slide 25 ---
XXIII.	Phase feeding
Each phase would represent a different energy requirement and therefore a different ration.
A.	Phase 1
1. First 10 weeks after calving
2. Rapidly increasing milk production
3. Cow is usually not able to eat enough and draws on body reserves to maintain production
B.	Phase 2
1. Second 10 weeks after calving
2. Maximum level of feed intake reached
C.	Phase 3
1. Last half of lactation
2. Milk production is decreasing
D.	Phase 4
1. Dry period of 7 to 8 weeks
2. Time for feeding calf and restoring body reserves

--- Slide 26 ---
XXIV.	Challenge feeding
A.	Cow is &quot;challenged&quot; to produce more milk by increasing concentrates before freshening
B.	Grain amounts are then increased until production no longer increases
C.	Grain amounts are then adjusted according to milk production
Maximum production may not always be the most economical, especially on cows that are not real efficient feed converters or when grain prices are high.  A cow&#x27;s response to challenge feeding is best early in lactation.

--- Slide 27 ---
XXV.	Group feeding
A.	Cows are divided into groups based on production
Number of groups will vary with size of herd and type of operation.
B.	Cows are fed in groups in some type of feed bunk
C.	Little or no grain is fed in milking parlor


--- Slide 28 ---
XXVI. Timing of feeding different feeds
Consumption is increased as number of feedings are increased.  Many dairies are using &quot;total rations&quot; where all the feeds are fed together.
A.	Hay--Generally free choice at all times
Waste can be controlled by feeding smaller amounts several times a day.)
B.	Silage--Once or twice a day depending on labor; fed after milking
C.	Grain--Twice a day
High producing cows need additional grain outside of the milking parlor since they are not there long enough to eat sufficient amounts.
D.	Water--Always readily available

--- Slide 29 ---
XXVII.	Feeding dry cows
A.	Roughages, especially grass or oat hay, should be the main feed to restore digestive system
B.	Corn silage can help maintain a proper phosphorus to calcium ratio
C.	Weight gain is desirable to recondition cows
Caution:  Cows must not be fat at calving, however.
D.	Grain should be started or increased 2 weeks prior to calving to condition digestive system; this should be limited to not more than 1% of body weight

--- Slide 30 ---
XXVIII.	Advantages of proper dry cow feeding
A.	Increased milk production
