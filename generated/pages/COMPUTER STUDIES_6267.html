FOUNDATIONS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE  
THE COMPUTER  
Please Watch  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLgTnkw558w  
The basic parts of a desktop computer are the   
 computer case ,  
 monitor ,  
 keyboard ,  
 mouse , and   
 Power  cord .  
Each part plays an  important role  whenever you use a computer.  
 
 
 


Computer case  
The computer case  is the metal and plastic box that  contains the main 
components  of the computer, including the  
 Motherboard,  
 Central processing unit (CPU), and  
 Power  supply.  
The front of the case usually has an  On/Off button  and one or more  optical 
drives . 
 Computer cases come in different shapes and sizes.  
 A desktop case  lies flat on a desk, and the monitor usually sits on top of 
it. A tower case  is tall and sits next to the monitor or on the floor.   
 All-in-one computers come with the internal components built into the 
monitor, which eliminates the need for a separate cas e. 
Monitor  
 


The monitor  works with a  video card , located inside the computer case, to 
display images and text on the screen. Most monitors have  control buttons  that 
allow you to change your monitor&#x27;s display settings, and some monitors also 
have built -in speakers.  
 Newer monitors usually have  LCD  (liquid crystal display) or  LED  (light -
emitting diode) displays. These can be made very thin, and they are often 
called  flat-panel displays .  
 Older monitors use  CRT  (cathode ray tube) displays. CRT monitors are 
much larger and heavier, and they take up more desk space.  
Keyboard  
The keyboard  is one of the main ways to communicate with a computer. There 
are many different types of keyboards, but most are  very similar  and allow you 
to accomplish the same basic tasks.  
 
Mouse  
 


The mouse  is another important tool for communicating with computers. 
Commonly known as a  pointing device , it lets you  point  to objects on the 
screen,  click  on them, and  move  them.  
 There are two main mouse types: optical and mechanical .  
 The optical  mouse uses an electronic eye to detect movement and is 
easier to clean.  
 The mechanical mouse  uses a rolling ball to detect movement and 
requires regular cleaning to work properly.  
Mouse alternatives  
There are other devices that can do the same thi ng as a mouse. Many people 
find them easier to use, and they also require less desk space than a traditional 
mouse. The most common mouse alternatives are below.  
 Trackball : A trackball has a ball that can rotate freely. Instead of 
moving the device like a mouse, you can roll the ball with your 
thumb to move the pointer.  
 Touchpad : A touchpad —also called a  track pad —is a touch -
sensitive pad that lets you control the pointer by making a drawing 
motion with your finger. Touchpads are common on laptop 
computers.  
 
 
 


 
Assembling  and disassembling  computer  case  
Part1: How to assemble a CPU step by step  
This part is all about CPU assembling. Specifically, you have to be very careful 
with this process.  
Following are the steps to assemble CPU:  
1. Take Inventory   
2. Make space and time  
3. Prepare your CPU case  
4. Install motherboard  
5. Install the processor  
6. Install the processor heat sink  
7. Install the RAM  
8. Install SMPS  
9. Install the HDD  
10. Install CD/DVD drive  
11. Connect Expansion cards  
12. Install SYS/Rear cooling fan  
13. Bus cable connection  
14. Power  Cable connection  
15. Front Panel connector connection  
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
1. Take Inventory:   
Before you start, take inventory of your parts. Make sure you have the 
following components and tools with you.  
1. Case/ Tower/Cabinet  
2. Motherboard  
3. Processor  
4. Heat Sink  and CPU Fan  
5. SMPS  
6. Hard disk drive  
7. CD/ DVD drive  
8. RAM  
9. CMOS Battery  
10. A good screwdriver sets  
 
 
2. Make Space, Make Time:   
Building a PC takes space. You can use your dining room table to build your PC. 
So, make sure you have plenty of working space and a few hours to proceed with 
minimal interruption. You must work on a flat, stable tabletop surface or bare 
floor, where you have room to lay out all of the items, to begin with, assemble.  
3. Prepare your CPU cabinet : 
Now it is time to prepare the case. Remove the case co ver from the CPU cabinet.  

You need to check Screw brass standoffs are perfectly placed or not. If it is not in a 
proper position, in that case, you need to position them accurately. (always check 
the manual and follow their instructions)  
4. Install the mot herboard:  
Fig: motherboard and Back panel cover  
You must take great care, especially when installing the motherboard. First, 
remove the motherboard of its packaging and put it on top of the antistatic bag it 
came in. Remember, you always want to safeguard  your components from 
potentially hazardous static electricity.  
1. You need to secure the motherboard onto the PC case/chassis and inspect carefully 
for any visible defects.  
2. Next, review the motherboard handbook, to make sure you are familiar with the 
motherboard layout and understand which socket is which. Manuals are immensely 
helpful, usually easy to read, and include illustrations instructions.  
3. Check the layout of the sockets on the motherboard. And confirm that the ports on 
your motherboard’s back panel match the holes on the case’s Input/output (I/O) 
shield installed in your case. If it is necessary, then remove the old I/O shield by 


tapping it firmly a few times with the thicker end of a screwdriver. And then 
replace it with the shield that came w ith the new motherboard.  
4. You need carefully position the motherboard on top of the brass standoffs. After 
that line up all the holes, use the screws that accompanied the case to fasten down 
the motherboard.  
5. Don’t forget to place the CMOS in the proper posi tion. 
5. Install the processor (CPU):  
Fig: CPU placement  
1. Use the unlocking mechanism to open the CPU socket which is, usually a lever.  
2. Carefully line up the pins and place the chip in its socket; it will fit only when 
oriented correctly. An arrow or a mis sing pin on one corner of the chip will show 
you how to line things up.  
3. Align with the triangular symbol with the processor and socket key marks, as 
shown in the Figure.  
4. Lower the lever to lock the CPU into place.  


6. Install the CPU heat sink : 
You should f ollow the manufacturer instructions to install the heat sink and the 
cooling fan. If you bought an OEM CPU and a separate heat sink, then you need to 
spread a thin layer of the thermal grease over the chip. The thermal grease ensures 
proper transfer of hea t. 
There are some heat sinks that come with this grease already applied. In that case, 
you don’t need to use thermal grease over the chip.  
1. Attach the clip that holds the heat sink in place, keeping in mind that it may require 
a fair amount of force. Again,  follow the instructions that came with the heat sink. 
They will show you how to fit it correctly. If you are in doubt, you can visit the 
manufacturer’s website for more information.  
2. Plug the CPU fan’s power connector into the proper connector on the mothe rboard.  
7. Install RAM memory:  
Fig: Install RAM  
1. Unlock the two tabs from both ends of the RAM slot.  
2. To install the RAM, insert them into the proper sockets and push down firmly but 
evenly until the clips on both sides of the socket pop into place. If your  


motherboard supports dual -channel memory, consult the user manual to determine 
which pairs of RAM sockets you should use.  
8. Install the Power Supply Unit (SMPS):  
Fig: Install Power supply unit (SMPS)  
1. Place the SMPS inside the CPU cabinet in the proper p osition. If you are not able 
to find the correct location, then check the manual.  
2. Final steps, to install SMPS, you need to tighten the screw to secure the SMPS to 
the case.  
9. To install HDD : 
You can see a 3.5 inch bay inside the CPU cabinet. If you are u nable to find it, then 
check the manual of the case to identify the bay location.  
Place the HDD inside the bay properly and tighten the screw.  


Fig: Install drives  
10. To install CD/DVD : 
You can see a 5.25 inch bay inside the CPU cabinet. If you are unable  to find it, 
check the manual of the case to identify the bay location.  
Place the CD/DVD inside the CPU cabinet to align with the 5.25 -inch bay. And, 
finally, you need to tighten all the screws to hold firmly.  
11. Install Expansion cards : 
Expansion cards h elp to increase the functionality of your computer. You can place 
Expansion cards on the motherboard.  


Fig: Install Expansion Cards  
PCI compatible expansion cards can place on the  PCI slots  of the motherboard.  
PCI-e compatible expansion cards can place on the PCI-e slots  of the 
motherboard.  
Video cards or graphics cards can place on the  AGP slot  of the motherboard.  
You must know about  various parts of a motherboard  such that, you can  
effortlessly identify the different connectors.  
12. Install Sys/Rear cooling fan : 
Cooling Fans  


Find the location where you can place the Sys/Rear cooling Fan. Generally, 
SYS/Rear cooling can place below the SMPS.   
Fig: Cooling fans  
13. Bus cable connect ion: 
Amazingly, bus cable or data cable connections are prime connections. Bus cable 
helps to share information or data between the storage device and motherboard.  
sata-pata bus and 
connector  
If your motherboard has a SATA Bus connector, then you need to use SATA 
cables . AND if your motherboard has a PATA Bus connector, then you can 
use PATA cable  or IDE cable . 


In general, two bus cables need to connect inside the CPU. First, Bus cable 
connects the HDD and motherboard. And the second Bus cable connects the  
CD/DVD drive and motherboard.
