How do you think an addict may find money for drugs?
Drugs has an effect on the crime in society. If an addict needs drugs and has no money to buy them the obvious solution is to steal money or items that can be sold for money.

Often, addicts steal from those closest to them &amp; hurt their families.

--- Slide 2 ---
What would happen to addicts if there was less drugs available?
In an ideal world, if police managed to get less drugs on the street then addicts would get help and clean up their act.

		We don’t live in an ideal world!

In reality, drug prices would go up. This means that the addict would need to get their hands on more money and would therefore commit more crime.

--- Slide 3 ---
What are problems with punishing the street drug dealers?
The dealers on the street are working for suppliers. If street dealers are arrested and imprisoned the suppliers find someone else to deal.
Ideally, police want to get to the suppliers (traffickers) rather than just the dealers. 
It is estimated that around 60-80% of illegal drugs around need to be taken off the street to put a drug traffickers out of business. This would be very difficult to do.

Social drugs - Social drugs are usually taken to help people relax, or on occasion to give a feeling of having more energy. Some are banned in many sports and are also illegal. The main social drugs are:

Caffeine - found in coffee, chocolate and &#x27;energy&#x27; drinks

--- Slide 6 ---
Drug classification
Since the misuse of drugs act 1971 became law, illegal drugs have been graded as class A, B or C. Drug classification is based on how harmful and addictive each particular drug is.
Most – A Least C
A – Heroin, ecstasy, LSD, Cocaine, crack cocaine – max 7 years prison for possesion, max life for supply.
B – Amphetamines (speed), Cannabis (pot, weed, skunk) – Max 5 years possession, max 14 years supply. 
C – Anabolic steroids (medical steroids prescribed by doctor, but can often used by bodybuilders), Tranquilizers (short term treatment for anxiety) – possession legal, max 14 years for illegal supply

See info sheets on arguments For and Against Legalising Cannabis

--- Slide 8 ---
Social drugs
Many supporters of cannabis becoming legalised point to other drugs which cause more harm and addiction than cannabis.
Nicotine (found in cigarettes) and alcohol are classed as social drugs. You still need a license to sell them and have to be 18 to buy them. However:
It doesn’t stop young people getting hold of alcohol and tobacco
Tobacco causes lung cancer, bronchitis and heart disease etc
Over 120,000 people die in Britain each year as a result of smoking-related diseases.
From 1 July 2007, it has been illegal to smoke in an enclosed public space or workplace
Both nicotine and alcohol can harm an unborn child
Alcohol is a depressant
Alcohol is involved in over 30,000 deaths in Britain each year, some caused by driving under the influence of alcohol
Alcohol causes liver damage, obesity and damage to the heart.
Both nicotine and alcohol are addictive (nicotine more so)
Excessive alcohol can lead to antisocial behaviour including violence, vandalism and rape.


--- Slide 9 ---
Tax on tobacco and alcohol
Both smoking tobacco and drinking alcohol are expensive habits. 
Cigarettes are very heavily taxed in order to encourage people not to smoke (tax and duty amount for around 80% of the cost of a packet of cigarettes). 
Alcohol is not taxed quite so heavily, but tax still makes up a significant amount of the cost in the hope that people will drink les. 
Heavy smokers and drinkers have to find thousands of pounds a year to buy their tobacco and alcohol. 
If the price rises, they have to either cut down (if they can) or find the money from elsewhere. 
This could of course leave a family with even less to buy the necessities of life.


--- Slide 10 ---
Tax on tobacco and alcohol
Some of the money collected in tax and duty goes towards funding the National Health Service, which has to cope with the extra demands put on it by smokers and drinkers. 
In 2007, health problems caused by alcohol cost the NHS around £2.7 billion; smoking-related illness cost less. 
In the same year, the cost to the NHS of drugs to help people quit taking drugs, drinking alcohol and smoking tobacco was around £111 million. 
However, the tax and duty raised from the sale of alcohol was around £8 billion, with a similar amount collected from tobacco sales. 
So the total cost to the NHS was around 30% of the total revenue. 
It could be said that smokers and drinkers subsidise other areas of public spending (including education).

Religious Views

--- Slide 13 ---
Christian Views
As Christians believe that God created humans they feel that they should look after their bodies.

“Your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit” means that they should respect their bodies and not do anything that will harm it.

--- Slide 14 ---
“Did you not know that your body is God’s temple?” ( The Bible)
“This changing water into wine was the first of Jesus’ miracles.” (The Bible)
“Don’t drink only water; a little wine will help your illnesses.” (From the Bible)
“The use of drugs inflicts serious damage on the body. Other than as medicine their use is a serious offence.” (Official teaching of the Catholic Church)
“The State has a duty to protect his citizens from the dangers  of alcoholism” (Official teaching of the Catholic Church)
“Do not get drunk with wine....that is a sin.” (From the Bible)
“Wine has been created to make people happy.” (From the Bible)
“Methodists should seriously consider total abstinence from alcohol.” (Policy document of the Methodist Church
“Members must refrain from alcohol and tobacco use.” (Document of the Salvation Army)

--- Slide 15 ---
1.	Explain the Christian views on drinking alcohol.
(think about why its ok to drink but not get drunk)

2.	How could the following quotes be used to express Christian views against the use of illegal drugs?
‘Your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit’
‘God made you in His image’
‘Love your neighbour’

	For both questions make sure that you give more than one Christian opinion.

Name the Christian groups.
You need to know a variety of different Christian teachings to get the highest marks in the exam.
Catholics  
Protestants
Methodists  
Salvation Army 
Rastafarian   
Jehovah’s Witnesses

--- Slide 17 ---
Rastafarians are a group of Christians who worship God, who they call Jah.
The majority of Rastas smoke canabis, known as ganja. 
In Rastafarianism Ganja is seen not as a &#x27;drug&#x27; or something to get &#x27;high&#x27;, but as a spiritual aid. They believe it helps meditation, cleans the body and mind, heals the soul, and brings them closer to Jah.
Cannabis is often referred to as the &quot;Holy Herb&quot; 
Rastas do not accept the use of other drugs such as, heroin, LSD, cocaine, and even alcohol. This is because those drugs are man-made or adapted with chemicals. 
They believe cannabis is a natural substance that Jah has created for use, as described in the Bible --
And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth…to you it shall be for meat.&quot; (Genesis 1:29)
Rastafarianism
