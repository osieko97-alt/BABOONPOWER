Definition of a Weed
The definition of weeds is predicated on human perception , desire and needs. 
 A weed is a plant which  interferes with human activity or welfare.
It is also defined as plant growing in a place where it is not desired at a particular point in time. 


--- Slide 3 ---
Origin and Evolution of weeds
In a stable (climax) vegetation, all  plant species are equally naturally adapted.
    Weeds evolved (i) when the stable environment is disturbed through human activities. 
(ii) from  ecotypes that have evolved from wild colonizers in response to continuous habitat disturbances and  selection pressures.
(iii) as a result of the  products of hybridization between wild domestic races of crop plants. 



--- Slide 4 ---
Effects of Cropping activities  and their effects on biodiversity
Practices that Increases  Biodiversity:
Intercropping 
Crop Rotation	
Cover cropping
 and Strip cropping

Decrease in Biodiversity  can be caused by:
 Monocropping 
Tillage 
 and Herbicides use


Biodiversity leads to more stability for the ecosystem as a whole.  


--- Slide 5 ---
Characteristics of Weeds  
Harmful to humans, animal and crops
Wild and Rank growth in an environment
Exhibits persistency
High reproductive capacity: large number of seeds, possess  diffeent types of propagules e.g.  Seeds, tubers  , rhizomes,  
Seed Dormancy : could be innate, induced or enforced.
Usually  present in large populations..
Could be regarded  as being useless, unwanted and undesirable
 They  exhibit spontaneous appearance without being  planted
Some exhibit mimicry. (seed, vegetative and biochemical )
Many weeds are aggressive and have rapid seedling growth 

--- Slide 6 ---
Economic Importance of Weeds
Reduction in crop yield through: 
       Physical Interaction (Allelospoly: competition for growth resources including water, light, nutrient, air, space.
        Chemical interaction (Allelopathy) 
Reduction in crop quality through
         - direct contamination of cultivated rice  and maize grain by wild rice
(Oryza longistaminata) and itch grass (Rottboellia cochinchinensis) respectively.; 
         -         contamination of  forage, silage or pasture crop .by  C. rotundus seeds , 
	  -	reduction in Sugarcane juice quality  by the  presence of sida.
	   -	Contamination of cotton lint by dried weed fragments 
         -         Damage of  underground tuber of yam and cassava through piercing of Spear       grass rhizomes  
Interference with field operations (harvest,pesticideapplication,etc.) 
Some are poisionous to grazing animals e.g. Euphorbia heterophylla, Halogeton glomeratus contain high oxalate content, it can kill livestock when eaten in dry season.
Some are harmful to grazing animals e.g. Amaranthus spinosus, Acanthospermum hispidus
increase cost of production; high cost of labour and equipment during harvesting.
Presence of weeds can impede water flow in irrigation canals
Weeds present in lakes and  reservoirs can increase loss of water by evapotranspiration




--- Slide 7 ---
Economic Importance of Weeds(contd.) 
Reduction in quality of pasture land; it  reduces the carrying capacity of grazing lands and pastures through their physical presence  and weediness
Reduction in quality of animal products;it affects the palatability of pastures, hay, silage etc. protein content in alfalfa wild garlic (Alliums spp) when eaten by cattle spoils the meat and the milk.
 Serve as alternate hosts for many plant diseases and animal pests e.g. insects, rodents, birds.  Cyperus rotundus serve as alternate to nematodes  and athropods
 Impose limitation to the farm size of a farmer
 Can serve as sources of fire  hazards



--- Slide 8 ---
Beneficial Effects of Weeds
Reduce erosion problem through the production of protective cover 
Help in nutrient recycling through decay of vegetative part.
Food/vegetables for humans e.g. leaves of  Talinum triangulare, and tubers of  Colocasia esculentus .
Serve as hosts and nectar  for beneficial insects
Beautification of the landscape e.g. Cynodon dactylon 



--- Slide 9 ---
Beneficial Effects of Weeds (contd.)
Feed for livestock and wildlife and aquatic organisms in form of hay, silage and forage / pasture, fruit seeds and branches and whole plant.
source of pesticides e.g.  Chrysanthemum cinerariifolium 
Source of genetic material for useful traits in crop improvement.
Medicinal use e.g neem ( Azadirachta indica), Ageratum conyzoides
Some serve as trap crop for parasitic weeds.
Habitat for wildlife and plant species hence biodiversity conservation.
Major role in carbon recycling through carbon sequestration. Field of exposed soil  always suffers a net loss in organic matter and releases carbon dioxide, while a field covered with crops and/or weeds takes up carbon dioxide.  This concept of  carbon sequestration is an added advantage of sustainable and organic farming.



--- Slide 10 ---
CLASSIFICATION OF WEEDS
Weeds can be classified based on 
(1)	Life cycle or history (Ontogeny) : Annual, Ephemeral, Perennial and  Biennials weeds
(2)	Habitat:(a) 	Upland (terrestial) weeds or dry land weeds (Agrestal /Weeds of arable or cultivated crops, and Ruderal weeds /weeds of disturbed non- cropped area such as rubbish heaps, landfills, paths, roads, compost heaps 
(b)	Aquatic weeds (Submerged aquatic, Floating aquatic, Emergent aquatic weeds

(3)	Growth habit: Free living (autotrophic) weeds
ii	Parasitic plants(Root parasitic weeds or obligate parasite, Stem parasitic weeds , Hemi parasitic weeds, Total parasites  Floating aquatic Emergent aquatic weeds
(4)	Degree of undesirability: ease and difficuly in controlling weeds.
(5)	Morphology : a.Form e.g. Woody Stem e.g Azadirachta  indica, 
 ii.  	Semi Woody weeds- e.g Chromolaena odorata, Sida acuta.
Iii	Herbaceous weeds: e.g Ageratum conyzoides, Talinum triangulare, 
		b.  Leaf Type : narrow leaf:	grass like(ii)	Broad leaf weeds (Dicotyledons):, Sedges; e.g. Cyperus rotundus, C. esculentus, Mariscus alternifolius 
 
(6)	Scientific classification (Binomial nomenclture): based on their taonomy (family,, genera and specific  epithet
(7)	Ecological affinities :  dryland weeds, gardenland weeds and wetland weeds
(8)	Origin: native or introduced.

WEED ECOLOGY
Ecology is the study of the relationship of plants and animals  to their physical  and biological environment. Physical environment like light, heat solar radiation, moisture, wind, oxygen, carbon dioxide, nutrient soil, water and atmosphere. Biological environment includes organism of the same kind as well as other plants and animals
Weed ecology is generally about the growth characteristics (ii) adaptation (iii) survival mechanism of weed that enables them to exploit environmental resources and successfully colonize new habitat often at the expense of other neighboring plants


--- Slide 12 ---
A habitat  is a dwelling place  or a kind of environment occupied by  the individuals of a species. Habitat may imply places like rubbish dump,  farm land or other sites occupied by weeds.


--- Slide 13 ---
Niche: it is the condition in a location under which a species can live successfully. Within the habitat, organisms occupy different niches. 
 A niche is the functional role of a species in a community—that is, its occupation, or how it earns its living. For example, the scarlet tanager lives in a deciduous forest habitat. Its niche, in part, is gleaning insects from the canopy foliage. The more a community is stratified, the more finely the habitat is divided into additional niches.


--- Slide 14 ---
WEED-CROP ECOSYSTEM
Ecosystem is the energy driven complex system in which the living organisms interact with themselves and the environment.
Weed- crop ecosystem involves weed-crop interaction as well as the nature and the function of that ecosystem. This will assist in understanding the impact of crop production and husbandry on the shifts in weed flora, for instance   the persistent of weed  in given weed- crop ecosystem.


--- Slide 15 ---
Persistence and survival mechanism of weeds
Weed persistence is a measure of the adaptive potential of weeds that enables them to survive in disturbed environment such as  i.  Crop land  ii. Recreational site iii. Irrigation canal and  iv. Pastures
The adaptive features or survival mechanisms of annual  weeds include: i. Production of large quantities of seeds ii. Seed dormancy and iii.  Periodicity of seed germination and short life span. 
The adaptive features of perennial weeds include: i. Deep rooting ii. Dormancy iii. characteristics of  buds on rhizome iv. Other modified stems  and v. Fragmentation of parts

 Types of   peennating and reproductive vegetative structures  in perennial weeds:
1. Rhizome – underground, horizontal stem (quackgrass, swamp smartweed) 
2. Stolon – aboveground, horizontal stem (bermudagrass) 
3. Tuber – swollen stem tissue (yellow nutsedge) 
4. Bulb – stem with shortened internodes and fleshy modified leaves (wild garlic)  
5. offset
6. bulbils
7. corm
8. runners
9. suckers



--- Slide 16 ---
Persistence and survival mechanism of weeds(contd.)
Storage organs may act as &#x27;perennating organs‘  These are used by plants to survive adverse periods in the plant&#x27;s life-cycle (e.g. caused by cold, excessive heat, lack of light or drought). During these periods, parts of the plant die and then when conditions become favourable again, re-growth occurs from buds in the perennating organs. For example geophytes growing in woodland under deciduous trees (e.g. bluebells, trilliums) die back to underground storage organs during summer when tree leaf cover restricts light and water is less available.

Crop mimicry
Crop mimicry is an example of the extent to which weeds have adapted themselves to survive  in that frequently disturbed site.
Crop mimicry is defined as the phenomenon whereby weeds develop morphological and or bioch</pre>
