Special groups of people

When planning meals for special groups of people, it is important to know
their, nutritional needs in order to meet them. Some special groups of
people include: Children, adolescents, the elderly, expectant and

* The food is rich in proteins, calcium, phosphorus, iron, carbohydrates and vitamins.
* The food is crunchy.
* The food is served on attractive dishes.
* The food should have vegetables.

* Are served in large quantities.
* Have plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables.

* Have roughage to prevent constipation and cardiovascular diseases. Planning Meals for Expectant and Lactating Mothers

An expectant mother is a woman who is pregnant, while a lactating mother
is a woman who is breastfeeding. The nutritional needs of expectant and
lactating mothers are the same. However, a lactating mother requires more
fluids and larger quantities of food. Planning Meals for Invalids and Convalescents

is a person recovering from illness. When planning their meals, ensure:

* Mix different types of plant proteins to provide all the essential
amino acids.

These are meals that are prepared, cooked, served and are eaten away from
home. They can be used during picnics, while travelling, school visiting,
tours and hospitals visits. Packing Materials and Equipment

Table setting

Table setting is the correct placement of table appointments required
during meals. This can either be formal or informal. A formal table
setting has more utensils and cutlery than the informal one in order to
cater for the many courses served during a formal occasion. Styles of Meal Service


There are many styles of meal service. In this topic four styles are
discussed:
* Blue plate
* Family service
* Buffet
* Tray service

Blue Plate Service

The food is served on individual plates and given to the diners who may
eat from table or anywhere they choose. Family service

In this service, the diners sit at a well set table and they serve
themselves or are served from the serving dishes. Buffet service

a) In this service, the buffet table is well laid out with stacks of
plates, cutlery and assortment of food systematically arranged. b) The diners queue and serve themselves or are assisted by hosts/
waiters. Tray service

A tray is used and is well set with appropriate crockery and cutlery and
the food is set for one person. It is suitable for invalids. Maternal Child Health Care

As you learnt in Form 1, this is a discipline that deals with child
development from conception to childhood with special attention to the
physical, emotional and social development of the child. Safe Parenthood


One needs to be adequately prepared for the role of parenthood since it
is an enormous responsibility.

Objective

By the end of the lesson, you should be able to explain the importance of

Safe parenthood ensures a:

1. Trouble free full term pregnancy

2. Safe delivery

Preparation for Safe Parenthood

In this lesson we shall look at the various factors that need to be

* Proper Nutrition
* Proper Social and Psychological Preparation
* Voluntary Counselling and Testing (VCT)
* Age of parent

Objective

By the end of the lesson you should be able to discuss the needs of a

Proper nutrition is important for both the mother and foetus. Lack of
enough nutrients in the diet may lead to improper development of the
foetus and endanger the life of the mother. Proper Social and Psychological Preparation

Emotional and social support from the family members and society are
important for a healthy pregnancy. The mother must be prepared
emotionally in order to adjust to the changes that will take place in her
body. Voluntary Counselling and Testing (VCT) It is important for the parents-to-be, to know their HIV status by
visiting a VCT clinic. If they test positive to the virus: 1. They will be counselled

2. The mother is given medical care to prevent mother-to-child
transmission. If negative, they are counselled and advised on how to
mantain their negative status. Age of parent

The recommended age for parenthood is between 18-35 years.
*A girl below 18 years is not physically mature to carry the pregnancy
and safely deliver the baby.
*A girl or boy below 18 years is not psychologically, socially and
financially prepared for the responsibility of parenthood. On the other
hand, an average mother-to-be may experience the following:
* Difficult in conception.
* Birth of deformed babies.
* Child has a high chance of getting genetic diseases.
* Mother may experience difficulty during labour. Pregnancy

Pregnancy is the period between conception and the delivery of a baby.
During this period mothers may suffer from some complications, these
include:

buttocks, thighs and abdomen. Backaches

The expectant mother may experience pain at the lower back as a result of
pressure exerted by the growing foetus on the spine. Anaemia

This occurs when there is lack of enough iron in the body due to iron
deficiency in the diet. Antenatal Care

Antenatal care is the care given to an expectant mother from the time of
conception to the time she delivers. Antenatal care is also referred to
as pre-natal care. Objectives

By the end of the lesson you shpuld be able to: i) Explain the impotance of antenatal care

iii) State the factors that affect normal foetal development. Importance of Antenatal Care

Antenatal care ensures: 1. The safety of the mother and the foetus. 2. Early detection of any pregnancy related problems so as to be managed
in good time. 3. Provides education on health and nutrition to the mother. 4. Reduction of maternal-child mortality. Activities at the Antenatal clinic


As soon as a mother suspects that she is pregnant, she should report to
