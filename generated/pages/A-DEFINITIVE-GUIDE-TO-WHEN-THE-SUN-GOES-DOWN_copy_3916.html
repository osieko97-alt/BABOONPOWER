1.  Plot   
a. Introduction  
 
We meet Mrs. Lilian Thurgood at the side of her house 
picking guavas. Her two dogs: Tembi and Tor alert her of 
somebody ‟s presence at her gate. She is not a very strong 
woman; she walks with the aid of a cane. Flowers  are 
everywhere sprouting in her compound and this gives her 
pleasure.  
 
 
b. Narrative Hook   
She engage ‟s the man at the gate in a conversation  
 
c. Rising Action   
William Sidlay has a letter to prove th at he is collecting 
money for some organization. He is looking for 
handouts(donations) if he can ‟t find work. Lilian doubts the 
authenticity of the letter.   
Even as she rummages for change in her purse, she knew she 
was making a mistake to empathize with W illiam. People like 
William took advantage of people like Lilian or murdered 
them. Lilian, like the rest of the whites, was filled with guilt of 
having gained her privileged position because of her race. She 
gives him the five rand, even though she could i ll afford it.  
 
d. Climax   
William offers to work for the money. He says it ‟s too 
much. She opens the gate for him to clean her garden, 
despite doubts. He however refuses to stop working when 
she (Lilian) makes the request. She had to go into the  
 
 
3 

 
house for the phone was ringing. William followed her 
there.   
e. Falling Action   
Lilian bids him to leave but he declines. He demands 10 
rand for his effort. When she threatens to call her 
husband, William tells her that she lives alone. He insists 
on ten rand besides the 5 he ‟d been given.   
f. Dénouement   
Feeling threatened she sets  the dogs on him. She gets a 
gun from her bedroom. She gets back her five rand before 
seeing him off. Although she comes out of the episode 
unscathed, she does not boast about it to her friends, may 
be still consumes with guilt. Where there was guilt there  
was opportunity. Write an essay to confirm this using   
Rayda Jacob ‟s The Guilt for your illustrations.  
 
 
 
2. Setting   
The story is set in s white suburb in South Africa.   
Mrs. Lilian (a pensioner) Thurgood ‟s home is a 
fortress, 10 foot high wall fence, and has a large 
compound in which she has fruit trees: guavas and 
lemons. She also has flowers in her garden: 
geraniums, basil and oregano. She lives alone. The 
incident with William takes place in the morning .   
3. Conflict.   
“The Guilt” has both external and internal conflict.

she had ignored many such calls.

- She also suffers from internal conflict when confronted 
with the forged letter William Sidlay presents. She takes 
it anyway.   
- She is faced with another instance of internal conflict 
when she discovers that she has 5 rand 23 cents. The five 
rand she thinks is too much and the 23 cents too little. 
She gives him the five rand in spite of herself.   
- Another instance of internal con flict is on the night it 
was raining and she had to get the door. She wonders 
whether it is racist to it one were afraid to open doors to 
strangers. She does it anyway to make for the guilt of 
benefitting from the old regime.   
ii) External Conflict   
- William Sidlay threatens Lilian physically. She gives 
Tembi &amp;Tor the first command which allowed them to 
terrorise but not draw blood. She wonders what they 
might do if she gave the second signal she doesn ‟t use it.   
- Next, she goes for the gun which she  uses to drive 
William out of her compound and survives a potentially 
murderous situation.

purports allows him to collect funds for 
an organisation. It is a plan to gain entry

the stoep deceives her that she will sell

she finds 30 plants planted and a bill of 
12 rand w hich she had to pay.   
iii) Race relations    The blacks do anything in their power to take advantage 
of the whites. 
 On their part, the whites feel inclined to help the 
blacks because of the guilt they have that their 
privileged position was a benefit of the previous 
white regime.  

their weaknesses. Using Rayda Jacob ‟s 
„The Guilt ‟ show that this is true. 

When the Sun Goes Down by Goro wa Kamau   
The Plot   
We meet Steve, a successful businessman, walking down the 
streets of his home town. He receives questioning stares from 
the people standing along the streets who pretend to be going 
on with their businesses while in truth they are discussing 
Steve. He runs  into his boyhood friends, Kanja. He invites 
Kanja to his home for a chat. He asks Kanja to tell him of the 
rumours about him doing rounds in the town. Kanja informs 
him that it is rumoured that he is marrying Maureen.   
We learn that people suspect that Maureen is infected 
with the HIV virus. Steve confirms it is true. Steve then 
relates the sad circumstances of Maureen ‟s marriage to an 
abusive and promiscuous soldier.   
When Kanja meets Maureen, she unashamedly opens up 
and tells him how she learned that she was infected with HIV. 
It was long after she had struck friendship with Steve and was 
carrying his child. It is at this point that Steve also took an 
HIV test and it turned out that he too was positive.   
Maureen serves  Kanja with juice he declines to take and 
finally Steve shares it with his son. This stigmatisation 
(discrimination) hurts Maureen and sends her into a 
depression. Despite Steve ‟s appeal to her that they fight the 
disease together, she is unable to overcom e her depressive 
mood.   
One evening while asleep, Maureen becomes delirious 
and starts mumbling bible verses. Tom, a sympathetic 
neighbor, helps Steve to take her to hospital. When Maureen 
realizes where she is, she stages a protest demanding to be 
taken h ome to die. She does not recover from her depression.

She is buried a week later. She leaves Steve and Kanja and 
Kimotho to continue the struggle.  
 
The Title   
The title, “When the Sun Goes Down”, is made in ref erence 
to Maureen ‟s feelings of depression, hopelessness and guilt to 
the point of giving up on life. It creates the impression that for 
her, all is lost.  
 
 
 
 
 
Setting   
The story is set in a rural town in Central Kenya. The villagers 
know each other by age, name and family. This explains the 
concerns of each other ‟s welfare. It also explains how this 
familiarity results into interference in the priv</pre>
