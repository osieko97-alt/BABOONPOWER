FORM FOUR  
 
 
rHAhTER ONE: QUR’AN 
 
Distinctive Features of the Qur’an  
 
In form two, we learnt that Allah (SWT) revealed various scriptures to different generations. Can 
you identify some of these scriptures? We also learnt the reasons why humankind needed divine 
guidance. Can we remind ourselves some of these reasons? You will realise that the main purpose of 
all the revealed scriptures was to guide humankind to the path of Allah (SWT).  
It is important to note that all the revea led scriptures have certain similar characteristics. Can you 
mention some of these characteristics? The characteristics you have mentioned differentiate the 
revealed scriptures of Allah (SWT’s) from all other books written by human beings. Among the 
charac teristics of revealed scriptures such as Taurat , Zabur , suhuf , Injil and Qur’an are as follows:  
 They were revealed by Allah  (SWT).  
 They teach Tawheed  (Monotheism).  
 They were sent to specific umma (nations) apart from the Qur’an which was sent to the 
entire  humankind.  Answer the following questions and activity in your I.R.E revision exercise books.  
 
1. a) Outline the early life of Imam  Ghazal  
b) State Imam Ghazal contribution to education  
2. Identify the Ten rules of conduct by Imam  Ghazal  
3. Outline the contributions of Shehu Uthman Dan Fodio to the development of  Islam  
 
Activity  
 
Using a table summarize the literary works of Imam al Ghazali and Uthman Dan Fodio.  

 
  They guide humankind on good morals and condemn immoral  practices.  
 Their message is simple, clear and straight  forward.  
 They were revealed through the  Prophets.  
 
In this chapter, we are going to study the unique and distinctive features of the Qur’an that 
distinguish it from the revealed scriptures we have mentioned earlier.  
 The Qur’an is the speech of Allah (SWT) revealed in its precise meaning and  wording.  
 It was revealed for the entire Alamin (mankind, jinns and ot her creations).  
 It has unique themes that have been integrated in different surahs  (chapters).  
 The literal style of the Qur’an is different from other  books.  
 It challenges humankind to come up with a book equal to the  Qur’an.  
 
Allah (SWT) has vowed to prot ect the Qur’an from any form of corruption or human 
interference. Allah (SWT) says, “We have, without doubt, send down the message; And we will 
assuredly guard it (from corruption).” [Q15:9]  
 
 
 
 
The Structure and Divisions of the Qur’an  
 
The word structure  or division in reference to the Qur’an is the arrangement of the content of the 
Qur’an in a systematic manner to form a whole. The Quran has its unique structure and division as 
follows:  
 
 
Ayat  
 
The word Aya (plural ayat) is an Arabic word which linguisti cally has several meanings as derived 
from its use in the Qur’an. Among these meaning include the following:  
a) A sign or an indication.  
Allah (SWT) says, “And their prophet said to them (children of Israil), the sign (‘ayah) if his 
Kingdom is that there shal l come to you a wooden box...” [Q 2:248]  
b) A lesson or an admonition to a group of  people.  
Allah (SWT) says, “ In this there is a lesson (‘ayah) for those who give thought.” [Q 16:11]  

| P a g e 441  
 c) A verse or a  sentence.  
Allah (SWT), “And when We change a verse in the Qur’an in place of another -and Allah 
knows best what he sends down -they say, ‘You (O Muhammad) are nothing but a forger.’ 
Nay, (but) most of them are ignorant.” [Q 16:101]  
Technically it refers to the shortest division of  the Qur&#x27;anic text, meaning, a phrase or sentence but 
most commonly referred to as ‘verse.’ Ayat vary in length. Some are short, consisting of only a few 
letters e.g. Alif Lam Meem, Ha Meem. Others are medium while others are long. During the early 
period of revelation (Makkan period) the Ayat were short and became longer as the revelation 
progressed in the Madinan phase. The longest ayat is found in Sura al Baqara [Q 2:282] and 
contains128 words. There are also short verses in the Qur’an comprising of just  few words or letters 
(abbreviated). Let us look at the short and abbreviated verses.  
 
 
Abbreviated verses in the Qur’an  
 
The Arabic language, which is the original language of the Holy Qur’an, has twenty nine alphabets. 
Coincidentally, there are twenty ni ne surahs (chapters) that start with abbreviations. It is only Allah 
who knows the translation and objectives of these abbreviated ayat. It is only sura tul Shura (Q 42) 
that has two sets of abbreviations at the beginning. There are fourteen letters that a re used in 
combinations of one, two, three, four and five letter words to form the abbreviated ayat. These letters 
are as follows : ي ه ن م ل ك ق ع ط ص س ر ح ا 
The table below shows the abbreviated Ayat in their various combinations:

Surahs  
 
The word Sura literally means an enclosure or fence such as the wall around a building. Technically, 
it refers the arrangement of the Qur’anic text into specific verses chapters. A surah consists of 
several verses. The Holy Qur&#x27;an has a total of 114 suras. These surahs vary in length the shortest 
consisting of four ayat while the longest has 286 ayat (Suratul Baqara). Surahs in the Qur’an are 
considered to fall into four main categor ies. These categories are as follows:  

| P a g e 442  
 a) Attiwal –comprising of the long suras. These surahs  include:  
 Sura Al Baqara (286  verses)  
 Sura Al Imran (200  verses)  
 Sura An Nisaa (176  verses)  
 Sura Al Maida (120  verses)  
 Sura Al An’am (161  verses)  
 Sura Al Aaraaf (206  verses)  
 Sural Attawba (129  verses)  
b) Al mi’un– suras comprising of about 100 Ayat in length or a little more or less. These surahs 
include the  following:  
 Sura Al Anfaal (75  verses)  
 Sura al Yunus  ( 
 
c) Al-Mathani (the repeated) suras which ar e suras from suratul Yasin [Q 36] to sura al  Hujura 
[Q 49].  
d) Al-Mufassalaat or the Surahs of al -Mufassal are the surahs starting from Surah no. 50 till the 
end of the Qur’an, i.e. Surah no.  111. 
Juz’u  
 
Juz’u is an Arabic word which literally means part or portion. The Holy Qur’an consists of thirty 
Juz’us (portions) of approximately equal length. Each Juz’u is further subdivided into equal portions 
called Ahzab . Each Hizb (singular for Ahzab) is in turn subdivided into four quarters; making eight 
quarters p er Juz’u.  
 
Below is a table which shows where each juz’u starts and ends. However, the translation of Abdullah 
Yusuf Ali has slight differences on where some of the surahs begin and end.

Ruk’u  
 
Ruk’u in relation to the Qur’an refers to divisions within the longer surahs to forms sections 
containing a number of verses dealing with one subject. These sections can be easily identified in the 
Qura’nic text since they have an Arabic symbol ) ع (at the end of th e last verse.  

| P a g e 444  
 Manzil  
 
The Qur’an is divided into seven portions containing several surahs. Each portion is equivalent to 
1/7 of the entire Quran. These portions are referred to as Manzil. This division makes the Qur’an to 
be recited wi thin seven days. The following table shows the division of the Qur’an into Manazil.
