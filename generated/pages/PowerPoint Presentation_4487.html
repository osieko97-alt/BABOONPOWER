Security threats and controls
There is need to protect data from theft because it used to make decisions in everyday life. Wrongful storage of data can lead to a number of evil activities if it reaches malicious people

--- Slide 2 ---
Data security core principles 
The three core principles of data security also referred to as information security are:
Confidentiality 
Integrity and 
Availability

--- Slide 3 ---
Confidentiality 
This implies that sensitive data or information belonging to an organization or government should not be accessed by or disclosed to unauthorized people. 
Such data includes: office documents, chemical formula, employee’s details, examinations etc.

--- Slide 5 ---
Availability 
Information must be available on demand
This translates to any information system and communication link used to access it, must be efficient and functional. An information system may be unavailable due to power outages, hardware failures, unplanned upgrades or repairs

Security Threats and Control Measures
Security threats of private or confidential data includes unauthorized access, alteration, malicious destruction of hardware, software, data or network resources as well as sabotage.
The main objective of data security control measures is to provide security, ensure integrity and safety of an information system hardware, software and data


--- Slide 7 ---
Information System Failure
Causes of computerized system failure include
Hardware failure due to improper use
Unstable power supply as a result of brownout or blackout and vandalism
Network breakdown
Natural disaster
Program failure
Computer virus attacks

--- Slide 8 ---
Control measures against hardware failure 
Computer systems should be protected from brownout or blackout which may cause physical damage or data loss by using surge protectors and UPS
Most organizations use Fault Tolerant Systems
A fault tolerant system has redundant or duplicate storage, peripheral devices and software that provide a fail-over capability to back up components in the event of system failure
Disaster recovery plans – involves establishing offsite storage of an organization ‘s databases so that in case of disaster or fire accidents, the company would have backup copies to reconstruct lost data from.

Threats from malicious programs
Malicious programs may affect the smooth running of a system or carry out illegal activities such as, secretly collecting information from an unknowing  user. Some of the malicious programs include:
Boot sector viruses
File viruses
Hoax viruses
Trojan Horse
Worms
Backdoors

Malicious Programs Insight
1. Boot Sector Viruses
They destroy the booting information on storage media
2. File Viruses
Attach themselves to files

Malicious Programs Insight
3. Hoax Viruses
Come themselves as email with attractive messages and launch themselves when email is opened 
4. Trojan Horse
They appear to perform useful functions but instead they perform other undesirable activities in the background.

Malicious Programs Insight
5. Worms 
This is a malicious program that self-replicates hence clogs the system memory and storage media
6. Backdoors 
May be a Trojan or a Worm that allows hidden access to a computer system.

Control measures against theft
Employ security agents to keep watch over information centers and restricted backup sites
Reinforce weak access points like the windows, door and roofing with metallic grills and strong padlocks.
Motivate workers so that they feel a sense of belonging in order to make them proud and trusted custodians of the company resources.
Insure the hardware resources with a reputable insurance firm.
Encrypt and create strong passwords for your data and access to computers

Piracy 
Piracy is a form of intellectual property theft which means illegal copying of software, information or data. Software, information and data are protected by copyright and patent laws
MK SOLUTIONS

--- Slide 15 ---
Control measures against piracy
To reduce piracy:
Enforce laws that protect the owners of data and information against piracy
Make software cheap enough to increase affordability
User licenses and certificates to identify original software
Set installation passwords that deter illegal installations of software

Fraud 
Fraud is a deception deliberately practiced in order to secure unfair or unlawful gain
Computer fraud is defined as any act using computers, the Internet, Internet devices, and Internet services to defraud people, companies, or government agencies of money, revenue, or Internet access. There are many methods used to perform these illegal activities. Phishing, social engineering, viruses, and DDoS attacks are fairly well known tactics used to disrupt service or gain access to another&#x27;s funds.

Threats to piracy and confidentiality
Privacy means that data or information  belonging to an individual should not be accessed by or disclosed to other people. Its an individual’s right to determine for themselves what should be communicated to others
Confidentiality – is the sensitive data or information belonging to an organization or government. Should therefore not to be accessed by or disclosed by unauthorized people

Control Measures Against Unauthorized Access

A. Firewall
A firewall is a device or a software system that filters the data and information exchanged between different networks by enforcing the host networks access control policy. 
The main aim of a firewall is to monitor and control access to or from protected networks
People who do not have permission cannot access the network and those within cannot access firewall restricted  sites outside their networks

B. Data Encryption
This is the process of mixing up data so that only the sender and the receiver can understand with use of an encryption key.
The translation of data into a secret code. Encryption is the most effective way to achieve data security. To read an encrypted file, you must have access to a secret key or password that enables you to decrypt it. Unencrypted data is called plain text ; encrypted data is referred to as cipher text.
There are two main types of encryption: asymmetric encryption (also called public-key encryption) and symmetric encryption.

C. Security Monitors
The are programs that monitor and keep a log file or record of computer systems and protect them from unauthorized access. E.g. 
Biometric Security
This type of security takes the user’s attributes such as voice, fingerprints and facial recognition.
Other access Controls measures Include:-
Enhancing a multilevel authentication policies such as assigning users log on accounts, use of smart cards and personal identification number (PIN)


--- Slide 28 ---
Policies and laws governing information security 
Introduction
Laws, regulations and policies enacted are meant to regulate  and govern data processing and information security. Laws can either exist as international laws enacted by ISO- International Standardization Organization an ISF- Information Security Forum
These are non-profit making organizations who also offer research on best practices 
There are also locally enacted laws to control the IT sector by Parliament and policies made by the ministry of Information and Technology
Examples of laws that exist include:
