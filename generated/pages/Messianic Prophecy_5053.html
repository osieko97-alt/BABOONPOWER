Represent God before men

--- Slide 4 ---
“Messiah”
Mashiach  means “Anointed” (Greek “Christ”)
    = Consecrated for service to God (YHWH)
There are 3 anointed offices in Hebrew Bible
Priest of Israel (Leviticus 4:3)
King of Israel (2 Samuel 19:21-22)
A Pagan King (Isaiah 45:1)
 The Unique Eschatological Servant of the Lord
Prophet      –        King                –    Priest
 
Like Moses – Son of David – Order of Melchizedek

--- Slide 5 ---
What is a Prophet?
“Navi” (Hebrew) 
	= A spokesman for God 
       “You shall be as my Mouth” (Jer 15:19)
Tests of a true prophet (Deut 18)
Does not use pagan divination (v. 9-13)
Speaks only in God’s name (v. 19-20)
Is completely accurate (v. 21-22)


--- Slide 6 ---
What is Prophecy? (1)
Forthtelling truth boldly
Announce &amp; proclaim God’s Message
 Expound &amp; explain God’s message (in both immediate and broader “sacred history” context)
 Exhort Israel back to covenant faithfulness
Ethical / moral standards (unlike false prophets who “tickle the ears” with lies: Micah 2:6-11)
Spiritual faithfulness (A watchman  held accountable gives warning: Ezekiel 3:17-33)
Proper worship and instruction (unlike wicked priests who dishonor the Lord’s table in Malachi 1:6-2:9)

--- Slide 7 ---
What is Prophecy? (2)
Foretelling = predicting a future reality (event or person) which is only knowable by supernatural revelation
 Types of Predictions
 Short-term individual (Death of Hananiah - Jer 28:15-17)
 Messianic historical (Birth of Immanuel - Is 7:14, Mt 1)
 Messianic in process (Sits at God’s right hand - Ps 110:1)
 Messianic eschatological (Eternal Kingdom - Is 9:7)
 National historical (Exile - Jer 25:11-12; Ezra 1:1-2)
 National in process (Valley of Dry Bones - Ezekiel 37)
 National eschatological (Messianic Kingdom - Is 35)

--- Slide 8 ---
4 Types of Fulfillments(Example: Matthew 2)
Direct fulfillment: v. 5-6
Bethlehem: birthplace of Messiah (Micah 5:2)
  Summary Fulfillment: v. 23
  “called a Nazarene” (Term of derision: Is 53 “despised”)
  Applicational fulfillment: v. 16-18
 “Rachel weeping for her children” (Jer 31:15) Rachel
   represents Jewish mothers mourning the loss of children.
 Midrash (rabbinic commentary) principle: “For any ancient 
   text, there can be an application for any time and place.”
 Caution: only a true to the text derived principle validates
   spiritual experience.
 Typical fulfillment: v. 14-15
 “Out of Egypt, I called my son” (Hosea 11:1) Israel is the
  type, Yeshua is the fulfillment. Type is supplied by Scripture.

Approaches to Messianic Prophecy 2

--- Slide 11 ---
Which Lens?
Back to the future: Hindsight Revelation only?
NT is not “the guide” to the OT 
NT is “the goal” of the OT
NT depends theologically on the OT
 Messianic Theme pervades all Scripture
 OT contains the messianic searchlight for the future 
 OT order/pattern of Messianic texts has meaning
 Genesis introduces messianic prophecy
 Revelation seals it.

Not Just
Visions of the future
Text

Sequence of events

Natural causes	
But Also
Visions for the future
Text and commentary
Explain prophet’s explanation of his vision
Interaction of events and texts
Allow supernatural

Is the Hebrew Bible Messianic?
Text-critical evidence  YES
Inner biblical evidence  YES
Canonical evidence  YES
N.T. Evidence  YES

--- Slide 14 ---
Text-Critical Evidence
History of the Hebrew text is “developed theology”
From the time of its composition …
During the process of its canonization …
Through the final stage of its consolidation.
Controversies influence the history of messianic interpretation even as the text develops
Controversy with rebellious sons (Cain, Edom, Absalom …) 
Controversy with disobedient kings (Saul, Ahab, Ahaz …)
Controversy with wicked priests (Eli’s sons …)
Controversy with false prophets (Hananiah, …)
Controversy with nations (idolatry, enmity with Israel)
Controversy with the “minim” (“apostates” – term wrongly attributed to  Jewish Christians since the 1st century A.D.)
Controversy with the Anti-Messianic spirit (Antichrist)

History of Hebrew Bible 1
Composition  1500 – 400 B.C.
Proto-Hebrew Text 
Pentateuch (Torah): canon by 622 B.C. 
  Canon  350 B.C. – 600 A.D.
 Final form: Torah + Prophets +Writings  350 B.C. 
 Septuagint LXX (Greek translation) Alexandria 250 B.C.
 Song of Songs added at Jamnia (Yavne) 70 – 132 A.D. 
 Qumran Scrolls 250 B.C – 110  A.D.
 “Controversy with the “minim” 70 – 600 A.D.
 Consolidation  600 – 1000  A.D.
 Masorah (“tradition”) =&gt; Masoretic Text ( + vowel points)

Minim Controversy

--- Slide 17 ---
History of Interpretation 1
Texts develop theologically not geographically
  Rashi, Kimchi, Medieval Jewish-Christian disputations
  Peshat: Literal meaning = Historical meaning 
  Used peshat to refute Christian messianic interpretations in OT
  Messianic predictions already fulfilled historically 
  Historical referents for Messiah: David, Hezekiah, Israel, etc.
  Controversy with the Minim affected the Masoretes’ 
     reading as they consolidated the Hebrew canon
 Vowel points added make certain MT passages less messianic 
 Older manuscripts (LXX, Samaritan, and Q) are more messianic
 Messianic passages tend to have more textual variants 
  Reformation Christian Hebraists read Rabbinic writings 
  They often adopt the peshat historical interpretations as true
  They use kabbalah to invoke a mystical sense (double fulfillment) 

--- Slide 18 ---
History of Interpretation 2
 Older variants (yellow) are also the better readings in each case above. 
 MT meanings (white) avoid Messianic interpretation or criticism of Moses.

--- Slide 19 ---
Inner Biblical evidence 1
In-textual
Words, grammar and syntax within text
Ex: “shiloh” contraction: “to whom it belongs” (“it” refers to “shevet” the scepter in Gen 49:10) 
Inner textual
Cross-reference from same book or same author
Israel’s King in Num 24:5-9 = the Lion of Judah in Gen 49:9-10  (Moses is the author of both books)
Inter-textual
Cross-reference from a different book or author
“I am going to make a ruin [of Davidic kingship] until He comes to whom it belongs” in Ezekiel 21:25-27

--- Slide 20 ---
Inner Biblical evidence 2
Checking for Messianic Clues
Broader literary context
Consistent structure? 
Narrative + Epilogue?
Poetic seams employ an eschatological phrase?
The Lion of Judah        Who dares rouse him up?  Gen 49:8ff 
“In the last days” Gen 49:8ff - Num 24: 14ff - Deut 31:24ff
  Nearer narrative context
  Gen 49:1-7 older brothers 
   disqualified from birthright
  Contents of prophecy
  Judah’s Pre-eminence 49:8
  Power of Judah 49:9
  Prince of Judah 49:10-12

--- Slide 21 ---
Canonical Evidence 1
Inclusion
Each book contributes to the Messianic theme
Prophets as God’s watchmen for the Messianic Promise recording with ever increasing clarity the messianic hope
Historical Books as chronicles of Davidic dynasty in connection with messianic promise (each king is compared to David, is he the One?)
Megillot as messianic narratives for the feasts of Israel which foreshadow Messiah (ex: Passover Lamb) 
Hagiographa (Wisdom Literature) as spirit of Messiah, expressing messianic ethics and messianic hope (ex: “My redeemer lives”)
  Test of canonicity: the Messianic thread is woven through
    book’s composition
 Ex: Pentateuch A single book with a single purpose!
  Psalter Messianic by authorial intent: David’s last words
  2 Sam 23:1-2 “Thus says David, Son of Jesse, the man raised up 
   declares about the Messiah of the God of Jacob, and the Delight
   of the songs of Israel: The Spirit of the Lord spoke by me …”

--- Slide 22 ---
Canonical Evidence 2
Composition of Pentateuch
Literary strategy  one story 
 Creation &amp; primeval history
 Preparation of people &amp; land
 Promise to/through seed of
   Abraham
 Postponement of possession
   of that land
Narrative blocks linked by single theme of faith with Law arranged around theme of broken faith
 Faith forgotten in Egypt
 Faith tested in wilderness
 Law &amp; Broken faith at Sinai
 Need for circumcised hearts
Epilogue: Messianic identification 
 Moses was great, but not the One 
  (Dt 34:9) Ezra’s appendix? (Ez 7:10)
 Concern: maintain messianic hope in
   the Promised One: prophet like 
   Moses
Punctuated by songs/poems carrying central messianic theme (as in a musical)
 Gen 49
 Num 24
 Deut 32

--- Slide 23 ---

Law
Nevi’im

Prophets
Ketuvim

Writings
   Final Shape (Ezra?) Ezra 7:10
  Messianic seams reveal authorial messianic intent
