Description:  
This unit is designed to provide pre -service teachers with a comprehensive understanding of theories 
and practices that underpin teaching and learning environments. Pre -service teachers will develop a 
critical approach to teaching and learning through engaging with research, scholarship and school - 
based professional experience that links theory and practice. They will critically address the 
complexities of teachers’ roles and practice, communication an d interpersonal skills, classroom 
management strategies, planning processes and diverse teaching and assessment strategies to 
support the needs of diverse learners.  Pre-service teachers will describe, analyse and reflect upon 
current pedagogical approaches through engagement in web enhanced environments, tutorials and 
assessment activities.  
 
Pre-service teachers will engage in critical reflection upon their developing  professional selves as 
confident and effective teachers, aligned with the Australian Professional Standards for Teachers at 
Graduate level.

The Faculty of Education and Arts is committed to preparing graduates who are workforce ready. 
Readiness for the practical demands of classroom teaching involves the capacity to apply theoretical 
knowledge. The ability to apply knowledge is reflected in the Australian Qualifications Framework 
requirements at Graduate level (http://www.aqf.edu.au/aqf/in -detail/aqf -levels/).  
This unit is an important part of your development as a teacher. Thus full engagement in this unit is

GRADUATE ATTRIBUTES  
Each unit in your program contributes in some way to the development of the ACU Graduate Attributes 
which you should demonstrate by the  time you complete your course . You can view the ACU Graduate 
Attributes for all courses at http://www.acu.edu.au/204356 . All Australian universities have their 
expected graduate attributes – ACU’s Graduate Attr ibutes have a greater emphasis on ethical 
behaviour and community responsibility than those of many other universities . All of your units will 
enable you to develop Graduate A ttributes . 
On successful completion of this unit, you should have developed your ability to :  
GA1 demonstrate respect for the dignity of each individual and for human diversity
