SEMESTER ONE 2019  
EDRS688: Interpreting and Designing Educational Research 
UNIT OUTLINE  
 
Credit points: 10 
Prerequisites/incompatibles : This is a core unit in the Master of Teaching (Primary) and Master of 
Teaching (Secondary). It has been written to contribute to meeting learning outcomes at AQF level 9.  
Lecturer in Charge : Amanda Gutierrez  
Office: 07 3861 6286  
Email: amanda.gutierrez@acu.edu.au  
Contact me: My preferred method of contact is via email. I will respond 
within 24 -48 hours. If I do not reply to your email within 48 hours, please 
re-send.  
Unit rationale, description and aim : A defining characteristic of professi onals is not just their 
specialised knowledge but their ability to reflect on that knowledge and to draw upon evidence to 
revise that knowledge in practice. Thus, it is important for educators, as professionals, to be able to 
consume and conduct research. This unit encourages pre -service teachers to be critical consumers 
of research and introduces a range of conceptual approaches and techniques in educational 
research. The unit grounds the pre -service teacher as teacher -researcher to enable them to self - 
audit pedagogical practices and understand and participate in research in informed and ethical 
ways.  
Mode : Attendance  
Duration : You should anticipate undertaking 150 hours of study for this unit, including 
tutorials/lectures, readings and assignment preparation.  


Page 2 of 18 Version:   LEARNING OUTCOMES  
The Master of Teaching (Primary and Secondary) course is a professional program that facilitates 
participants’ achieving teachers’ professional standards and ACU graduate attributes. These 
attributes are incorporated into the unit learning outcomes.  
On successful completion of this unit, you should be able to:  
1. appraise key research principles, methodological approaches and methods app licable to 
educational research and professional practice (GA3, GA5; APST  3.6); 
2. apply skills in identifying, analysing, and synthesising educational research literature as a source 
of professional learning (GA3, GA4, GA8; APST 1.2, 6.2, 6.4,  7.4); 
3. conceptu alise and plan an enquiry -based project established through critical self -auditing of 
pedagogical practice, with reference to the Australian Professional Standards for Teachers: 
Graduate (GA4, GA5, GA8; APST 3.6,  6.1); 
4. demonstrate  in-depth  understanding  of and apply  principles  and practices  of ethical  conduct  in 
human research (GA3, GA7, GA8, GA9; APST  7.1); 
5. critique a range of strategies for collecting and analysing data to assess the impact of 
pedagogical practices on student learning (GA4, GA5, GA8; APST 5.1, 5.3, 5.4, 6.3);  and 
6. communicate in writing in a proficient, professional and scholarly manner  (GA9).  
AUSTRALIAN PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS FOR TEACHERS - GRADUATE LEVEL  
1.2 Demonstrate knowledge and understanding of research into how students learn and the 
implications for teaching.  
3.6 Demonstrate broad knowledge of strategies that can be used to evaluate teaching programs to 
improve student learning.  
5.1 Demonstrate understanding of assessment strategies, including informal and formal, diagno stic, 
formative and summative approaches to assess student learning.  
5.3 Demonstrate understanding of assessment moderation and its application to support consistent 
and comparable judgements of student  learning.  
5.4 Demonstrate the capacity to interpret student a ssessment data to evaluate student learning and 
modify teaching  practice.  
6.1 Demonstrate an understanding of the role of the Australian Professional Standards for Teachers 
in identifying professional learning  needs.  
6.2 Understand the relevant and appropriate sou rces of professional learning for  teachers.  
6.3 Seek and apply constructive feedback from supervisors and teachers to improve teaching 
practices.  
6.4 Demonstrate an understanding of the rationale for continued professional learning and the 
implications for improve d student  learning.  
7.1 Understand and apply the key principles described in codes of ethics and conduct for the 
teaching profession.  
7.4 Understand the role of external professionals and community representatives in broadening 
teachers’ professional knowledge and practice.  
GRADUATE ATTRIBUTES  
Each unit in your course contributes in some way to the development of the ACU Graduate 
Attributes which you should demonstrate by the time you complete your course. You can view the 
ACU Graduate Att ributes for all courses at http://www.acu.edu.au/204356. All Australian universities  

Page 3 of 18 Version:   have their expected graduate attributes – ACU’s Graduate Attributes have a greater emphasis on 
ethical behaviour and community responsibility than those of many other universities. All of your 
units will enable you to develop some attributes.  
On successful completion of this unit, you should have developed your ability to: 
GA3 apply ethical perspect ive in informed decision making;  
GA4 think critically and reflectively;  
GA5 demonstrate knowledge and skills appropriate to the discipline; 
GA7 work both autonomously and collaboratively;  
GA8 locate organise, analyse, synthesise and evaluate information; 
GA9 demonstrate effective communication in written English language.  
CONTENT  
Topics will include:  
• The nature of educational research and major approaches and research designs applicable  to 
applied educational research within professional  contexts  
• Processes and approaches to defining and justifying a research problem, researchable 
questions and creating a conceptual framework derived from the literature and self -audit of 
pedagogical practices and the Australian Professional Standards for Teachers:  Graduate  
• Information literacy including principles and tools for identifying and critically reflecting upon high 
quality research; (literature reviewing, databases, bibliographic tools, research  quality)  
• Principles of ethical data collection and analysis te chniques commonly used in educational 
research  
• Strategies to record, interpret and analyse student assessment data in order to evaluate student 
learning and modify teaching  practice.  
• Assessment strategies, including informal and formal, diagnostic, formati ve and summative 
approaches to assess student  learning  
• Purposes of assessment ‘of learning’, ‘for learning’ and ‘as  learning’  
• Principles and practices of assessment moderation and its application to support consistent and 
comparable judgements of student  learning  
• Conventions of professional academic writing and  publishing.  
QUALITY ASSURANCE AND STUDENT FEEDBACK

feedback is valuable to improve the quality of the unit. Please ensure you complete the SEU survey 
for the unit. You can also provide feedback at other times to the unit lecturer, course coordinators 
and/or through student  representatives.  
 
LEARNING AND TEACHING STRATEGY AND RATIONALE  
The unit will incorporate  a range  of online  teaching  and learning  activities  including  readings,  lecturer’s

Page 4 of 18 Version:   unit outline. Assessment tasks are designed to help you develop your capacity to engage in teacher 
research.  
Duration  
150 hours in total with a normal expectation of 36 hours of directed study and the total contact hours 
should not exceed 36 hours. Directed study might include lectures,  tutorials, webinars, podcasts etc. 
The balance of the hours then become private study
