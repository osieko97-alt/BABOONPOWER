--- Slide 4 ---
What is a computer system
A computer system is the hardware and software that work together to perform a useful task. 
Hardware - equipment and cables that can be physically touched.
Software is not visible to the human eye because it consists of a program and data stored electronically  The hardware for a computer system can be simplified to:


--- Slide 5 ---
Operating Systems
An operating system is software which controls the general operation of a computer. An operating system
controls the loading   
...and running of programs (interpreting and executing each command) 
controls the use of peripherals such as disc drives and printers 
organises the use of the computer’s memory. 
handles interrupts (signals from devices) 
maintains security (passwords etc) 


--- Slide 6 ---
RAM and ROM 
RAM and ROM are the two different types of main memory inside the computer
RAM – Random Access Memory – memory that the user can use to store programs and data that are being used at the moment.  Wiped when the computer is switched off.
ROM – Read Only Memory – memory which is permanently set when it is made.  Contains instructions and data that are needed all the time.  Is permanent, so not lost when the computer is switched off. 

--- Slide 7 ---
Cache Memory
Modern software usually requires a large amount of memory in a computer in order to operate.  

Most computers use a part of the hard disk as extra memory. Data stored in memory which is not actually needed immediately is temporarily moved into the disk cache and moved back into memory when it is needed. The computer will seem to have more memory than it really has. 


--- Slide 8 ---
How Computer Memory Is Measured

--- Slide 9 ---
Input Devices
Mouse, rolled on a table and a ball underneath sends details to the computer
Tracker ball, like an upside-down mouse, where the ball is moved by your hand
Light pen, often used to actually point at the screen
Touch screen, where you use your finger to point at points on the screen
Touch pad, often found on portable computers, where you just move your finger around the pad
Joy stick, where you hold a stick and move it around.

--- Slide 10 ---
OMR
Optical Mark Recognition – it detects marks made on paper
The OMR reader shines light on the paper and measures the amount of light reflected back, so finding out where marks are on the paper.  
Used to automatically mark multiple exam papers (eg SATs),  and for lottery tickets 

--- Slide 11 ---
OCR 
Optical Character Recognition – similar to OMR but the computer recognises the shape of printed characters.  
Used by scanners to recognise text 
By places such as gas companies to automatically read customer numbers on bills when they are paid 

--- Slide 12 ---
MICR 
Magnetic Ink Character recognition.  Special ink containing iron filings is used to create specially formed characters that can be read in a machine that magnetises the ink. 
Almost impossible to forge but more expensive than other methods.  
The only common use is for the characters at the bottom of cheques. 

--- Slide 13 ---
Concept Keyboards 
A touch sensitive pad where a paper overlay can be used to show different areas.  
Used in McDonalds etc, 
in supermarkets such as Safeway where fruit and veg are weighed, 
in schools where young children can touch pictures on the overlay keyboard more easily than type things on a normal keyboard. 

--- Slide 14 ---
Video Digitiser
An interface between a video / video camera and a computer.  Converts the signals from the video into signals that can be used by the computer.  
Used when you want to use images from TV programmes in work on a computer 

--- Slide 15 ---
Graphics Tablets
An input device which is usually about the size of A4 paper, using a pen and a touch-sensitive surface.
Used for inputing accurate diagrams with a CAD package

--- Slide 16 ---
MIDI 
Musical Instrument Digital Interface
Used to connect a musical instrument such as a keyboard to a computer
So that music can be played on the instrument and stored and processed on the computer
Also used to link more than one instrument together.

--- Slide 17 ---
Printers 

--- Slide 18 ---
Plotters 
A device that uses pens to draw out diagrams on paper
Used with CAD programs for creating large, accurate, high quality drawings and plans 

--- Slide 19 ---
CD-ROMs, floppy discs and hard discs

--- Slide 20 ---
Magnetic Tape 
Magnetic tapes can be on large reels (like you see on the films!) or on small cassettes.
Large tapes are often used as backing storage for mainframe computers
Cassettes are used on micro-computers
Tapes use SERIAL ACCESS only so it is not quick to access the data – you have to go through everything in the order in which it was stored
Tapes are often used for backup (we use a tape to backup the hard discs on the network) or for archiving (storing old versions of files)

--- Slide 21 ---
The main features of a Windows environment (GUI)?
Windows you can move around the screen,
Icons you can click on to load programs and files
Menus to choose from
Pointer you can move around the screen 
REMEMBER:  W.I.M.P!

--- Slide 22 ---
The alternative to a GUI 
Command line user interface, where the user types commands  Eg MS DOS
The user must learn lines of command language to operate software

--- Slide 23 ---
Advantages and disadvantages of a GUI over a command line interface 
Advantages:
GUI easier for a beginner – no commands to learn
Less likely to make mistakes – easy to type a command in wrongly

Disadvantages:
GUI take up more memory and need more powerful machine to run
GUI often slower to use if you are a quick typist
Some people with physical difficulties, eg poor hand control, blind people, find GUI difficult or impossible to use. 

--- Slide 24 ---
The main functions of an operating system 
Communicating with the user, 
controlling peripheral devices such as printers, 
sharing network resources (processing time etc) between users on a network 
checking passwords

--- Slide 25 ---
C2b
Information Systems

--- Slide 26 ---
Information and Data
An information system consists of hardware and software working together, takes data as  input and converts it into information.
An information system processes the data to produce information

--- Slide 27 ---
Data capture form
Most organisations use a form to collect data – paper based or screen based
A form should include
A title
A logo (if appropriate)
A prompt which represents each item of data to be collected
A suitable place to enter each item of data, the space can be on a line or in the form of a box, tick box or radio button
Suitable instructions, either  on or with the form
Suitable text on the purpose of the form
When designing a form the following should be considered
Suitable font for intended audience
Fonts should vary in size to emphasis section and headings
Colour should be used to enhance the form where appropriate
Images should not obscure areas of the form
Instructions should clearly explain the purpose of the form

--- Slide 28 ---
Data verification
When a paper based form is used it is necessary to enter the data into the computer
Most common form of verification is to key data in twice by two different operators and the computer compares the two sets of data – mismatched data is rejected and rejected data is renentered
Another method of verification is proofreading

--- Slide 29 ---
Data validation
Data collected using a data entry screen must be checked by the software before it is accepted by the computer system to ensure that it is acceptable and sensible – known as validation
Validation of data ensures that the data is present, of the correct type, in the correct range and of the correct length
A validation check is made automatically by the system and error message is displayed if the data is incorrect

--- Slide 30 ---
Validation Types

--- Slide 31 ---
Data Portability
Data portability is the ability to transfer data from one system or software application to another without having to re-enter the data.  The format in which data is held will indicate whether or not data is portable between different software applications and different computer systems.

--- Slide 32 ---
Data Compression
When storing a file, a program can be run which compresses the data so that the data takes up less storage space.  This is useful when files are to be transmitted over a network or attached to an email as the transfer will take less time.
A disadvantage is that the file will need to be decompressed before it can be used. 
A special program is needed for compression and for decompression although some compressed files will automatically decompress themselves.

--- Slide 33 ---
Database Terms
File
A complete collection of related data, eg a file of books in a library
Record
All the data about one item in a file, eg one book
Field
An item of data in a record, eg Title of book

--- Slide 34 ---
What is a database
Databases are organised collections of data stored on a computer system.
Data can be stored in tables
In most tables there is a key field – a unique field that identifies a record 

--- Slide 35 ---
Databases allow the user to.. 
define the data structure (field names and types) 
enter and edit data 
import data from saved files or other applications 
search for data by using queries (including AND, OR and NOT) 
sort data into alphabetic or numeric order 
validate data on entry 
output reports which may include totals, averag</pre>
