Welcome to 501 Synonym and Antonym
Questions! This book is designed to help you prepare
for the verbal sections of many assessment and entrance
exams. By completing the exercises in this book you will also increaseyour vocabulary and reﬁne your knowledge of words.
Most standardized tests—including high school entrance exams,
the SAT, civil service exams, and the GRE—use synonym andantonym questions to test verbal skills. These questions ask test tak-ers to identify the word that is most similar or dissimilar to anotherword, effectively testing their knowledge of two words.
The questions in this book, for the most part, are grouped into sec-
tions of questions that ask you to select a word’s synonym andsections that ask you to select a word’s antonym. There are two sec-tions that include questions asking for either the synonym or theantonym.
The questions increase in difﬁculty as you move through the exer-
cises of each chapter. Because this book is designed for many levelsIntroduction

of test takers, you may ﬁnd that some of the more advanced questions
are beyond your ability. If you are using this book to study for a highschool entrance exam, you may get a number of questions that appearlater in a section wrong. Don’t worry! If you are getting the earlierquestions correct, you are probably in good shape for your test. How-ever, if you are studying for a graduate level exam such as the GRE,the full range of questions presented is appropriate for your level.
The questions in this book can help you prepare for your test in
many ways. First, completing these practice exercises will make youfamiliar with the question format. They will also get you thinking ofwords in terms of other words with similar or opposite meanings. Inthe test-taking environment it can be difﬁcult to switch gears fromsynonym questions to antonym questions; completing these exerciseswill make these mental gymnastics more comfortable.
Second, your performance on these questions will help you assess
your vocabulary level. For example, a word may be familiar to you—you may have seen it in print and have a general sense of what itmeans—but when tested, you may discover that you do not know theword’s precise meaning. These exercises will help you pinpoint thosefamiliar words for which you need to learn the exact deﬁnition. Inaddition, you will probably encounter words that are totally unfa-miliar. By memorizing their deﬁnitions, you can add these words toyour vocabulary and call upon them at test time to improve yourscore.
Third, many of the questions in this book, and on assessment
exams, test your ability to discern nuance of meaning. The questionmay ask you to identify the synonym for a secondary deﬁnition of acommon word—for example, “inclination or natural ability’’ is a sec-ondary deﬁnition of the word “bent.’’ Also, the direction for theseexercises usually ask you to identify the word that is “ most similar’’ or
“most dissimilar’’ in meaning to the word in the question. This means
that you may be asked to pick between degrees of meaning. For
x501Synonym &amp; Antonym Questions

xiexample, “atrocious’’ means “utterly revolting’’; in this case, “revolt-
ing’’ would be a more accurate synonym than “unpleasant.’’
Each question is fully explained at the end of the chapter. The
answer keys give you not only the right answer but also the deﬁni-tions of the word in the question and the correct answer. Use yourperformance to create a study guide. For example, make a list of allthe words that you missed and their deﬁnitions. Then study this listas a quick and concentrated method to improve your vocabulary. Insome cases, you will also beneﬁt from looking up the deﬁnitions ofthe words that you selected incorrectly to ensure that you know theprecise meaning of these words. Then add these words to your studylist as well.
You have already taken an important step toward improving your
vocabulary and your score. You have shown your commitment bypurchasing this book. Now all you need to do is to complete each 35to 40 question exercise, study the answers, and watch your vocabu-lary increase. You can even work in pencil and do the exercises againto reinforce what you have learned. Good luck!501Synonym &amp; Antonym Questions
