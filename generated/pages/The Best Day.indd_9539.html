The best day
There was once a vi llage ca lled Bado. 
It was on the hi lls of Riwa and Wera. 
The two hi lls faced each other. 
Between them was a wide va lley. 
The va lley was a lso ca lled Bado.  
Crops grew we ll in the va lley. 
Anima ls got grass from the va lley too.

There was a big river in the va lley.
It was ca lled River Pa la.
River Pa la had c lean water the who le year. 
The peop le in Bado used the water from 
River Pa la in their homes.
Farmers of Bado a lso used the water in 
their farms.
Birds and anima ls a lso drank the water.

Each of the hi lls had a schoo l.
Riwa Primary Schoo l was on Riwa Hi ll. 
Wera Primary Schoo l was on Wera Hi ll. 
Chi ldren from Riwa Hi ll went to Riwa 
Primary Schoo l.
Those from Wera Hi ll went to Wera 
Primary Schoo l. 
The chi ldren p layed together in the va lley.
Sometimes, the schoo ls p layed against 
each other.

On Saturdays, chi ldren took anima ls to the 
va lley. 
All the anima ls grazed together. 
They a ll drank water from River Pa la.
The chi ldren looked after the anima ls 
together.
They were friend ly to one another. 
The anima ls rested after grazing. 
When the anima ls rested, the chi ldren 
played.

The chi ldren formed p lay groups. 
They p layed different games. 
They sang and danced. 
They p layed ‘throw and catch’. 
They aimed at things and raced.Some of them p
layed ‘bu ll fighting games’. 
Fina lly, they swam in River Pa la.
The chi ldren enjoyed p laying together.

As they p layed, the chi ldren took turns to 
check on the anima ls. 
A bird ca lled ‘Hoya’ to ld them the time to 
go home. 
It a lways sang in the evening. 
The chi ldren knew the song. 
It said, “The hyena wi ll eat. Take the 
anima ls home!”
Quick ly, the chi ldren wou ld take the 
anima ls home.
The chi ldren wa lked behind the anima ls.
They took two roads, one to Riwa Hi ll and 
another to Wera Hi ll.

The anima ls wa lked home in a line.
The chi ldren p layed music with their sticks. 
They hit the short sticks on the long ones.
The chi ldren a lso danced on their way home. 
One by one, the chi ldren reached their homes. 
Those from near the va lley were the first to 
get home. 
Those from far up the hi lls got home last.

At times, the grass on the hi lls dried.
One day, boys from Riwa and Wera 
Primary schoo ls met. 
The boys met in Bado Va lley. 
They had gone to cut grass. 
Each schoo l kept two dairy cows. 
The cows had no grass to eat 
on the hi lls.

The Wera team was led by Babu.  
All the pupi ls were in C lass Two. 
Tito and Babu knew each other. 
They were friends.The chi

They fe lt tired and sat down to rest.

The boys sat under a tree and ta lked.
One of them asked, “What day is it today?”
Another answered, “Today is Monday.” 
Some ta lked about the best day of the week. 
Others ta lked about the days they did not
