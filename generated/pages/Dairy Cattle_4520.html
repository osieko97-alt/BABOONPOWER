Breeds

--- Slide 6 ---
Warm-up
First thing that comes to mind when you see…. 

--- Slide 7 ---
Lesson Essential Question
How are Dairy Breeds Selected?

--- Slide 8 ---
Holstein
Dominate the industry
+90% of the dairy cattle in the US
Officially known as Holstein-Fresians
From Netherlands and Northern Germany
Arrived in US in mid-1800s
Typically black and white in color
Total milk solids % are lower
Solids refer to milk fat solids found in milk. These are used to determine quality and use of the milk produced by that breed of cattle

--- Slide 9 ---
Holstein

--- Slide 10 ---
Jersey
2nd in popularity
Developed on the island of Jersey, off the coast of France
First imported early 1800s 
Coat color ranges from light tan to almost black
Ability to efficiently convert feed to milk
Lower body maintenance needs
Amount of milk produced per cow is lower
Total solids %- highest of all breeds

--- Slide 11 ---
Jersey

--- Slide 12 ---
Brown Swiss
3rd most popular
Originated Switzerland
Came to US in mid-18002
Normally brown to gray
Similar to Holsteins in size
Known for ability to produce milk in hot climates
2nd in milk production
Total solids % in middle of all breeds

--- Slide 13 ---
Brown Swiss

--- Slide 14 ---
Ayrshire
Red and white 
Imported early 1800s
Milk production midrange of all breeds
Total solids % low 
Originated Ayr district of Scotland

--- Slide 15 ---
Ayrshire

--- Slide 16 ---
Guernsey
Developed Island of Guernsey (coast of France)
Imported early 1800s
Medium sized red and white breed
Golden Guernsey milk lower in total solids then Jersey milk
Deep yellow/golden milk due to beta carotene (precursor to vitamin A)

--- Slide 17 ---
Guernsey

--- Slide 18 ---
Milking Shorthorn
3,150 in 2008
Originated from base stock of beef shorthorns and may be red, white, red and white or roan.
Known for high levels of fertility, grazing efficiency, and ease of management

Dairy Judging for Production
Competition between farmers
Compete for money and prestige within the industry
Dairy Cattle Judged On:
Physical Appearance 
Fore legs, Rear Legs, Utter, Hooks, Pins, Top Line (Spine) 
Other areas to consider when choosing cattle for production:
Mothering ability, efficiency on feed and grass, Quality of Milk, Milk solids and fat 

--- Slide 24 ---
Activity
Students will be given a packet on how to judge dairy cattle. They will answer the questions and then judge the pictures they are given.  
Answer the following summary questions
Who designed the judging booklet?
What categories are dairy cattle judged on? (in the front of the packet)
Explain what the judge would be looking at/for each of the 4 categories.
Write a sentence using the following for each of the 4 categories
Positive Term 
Negative Term
What should you do when placing a heifer class?
What do we find on dairy scorecard?
What is the typical judging format for a contest?
Give one helpful hint in deciding a placing
Explain how someone would present and prepare oral reasoning when judging cattle
Why would we have these contests?

Dairy Cattle
Industry Overview

--- Slide 26 ---
Warm-up	
What do you think of when you 
see this? 

--- Slide 27 ---
Essential Question
How is the Dairy industry so efficient ?

--- Slide 28 ---
Dairy Cattle Industry
Most difficult to manage
High producing dairy cows bred to give large amounts of milk that can overwhelm the animal without proper management
Value of dairy products exceeded $37 billion nationally
Most labor intensive
Milking 2-3 times a day, 7 days a week
Consumer demand lower fat diets
Food scientists respond with specialty items
Ex: Fat-free yogurt, cream cheese, and frozen dairy deserts

--- Slide 30 ---
Dairy Cattle Industry
Rank in Production- top 5
California
Wisconsin
New York
Pennsylvania
Idaho

--- Slide 31 ---
Dairy Cattle Industry

--- Slide 32 ---
Dairy Cattle Industry: Important Trend
Fewer dairy farms own more cows but still more milk per farm because of more milk per cow 

--- Slide 33 ---
Dairy Cattle Industry
2008- 70,000 operational dairy farms
40 years ago- 2 million dairy farms
# of farm declines, but pounds of milk increased by 20,000 pounds per cow
2009- 9.2 million dairy cows in the US produced over 185 billion pounds of milk worth over $37 billion
US leads the world in milk production per cow and in total milk production

--- Slide 34 ---
Hoard’s Dairyman Activity
Choose your magazine.
Answer the following:
What is the Hoard’s Dairyman? 
Why would this magazine be produced?
Choose an article in the magazine. Read the magazine. Provide a summary. Include something interesting you learned in the article. Why do you think this article was written.
Find 3 patterns you notice throughout the magazine. Explain the patterns
What sort of products do you see? What are they used for?
These magazines contain research related articles. Find a research related article and explain what was researched, why it was researched, and why dairy farmers might find the information useful. Does the research suggest a change in practices? If so, what changes?
Why would this periodical (magazine regularly printed) be an asset to the Dairy industry?

Milking

--- Slide 36 ---
Milking
Cows are milked 2 times a day, some 3 times
Fill in organizer as we go

--- Slide 37 ---
The Milking Process
1. At milking time, wash the teats, wear gloves
Disinfecting the teats and triggers the release of oxytocin, which initiates milk let-down

--- Slide 38 ---
The Milking Process

--- Slide 39 ---
The Milking Process
2. Teats are then dried with individual paper towels

--- Slide 40 ---
The Milking Process

--- Slide 41 ---
The Milking Process
3. One inflation of the milking claw is placed on each teat or quarter

--- Slide 42 ---
The Milking Process

--- Slide 43 ---
The Milking Process
4. Vacuum applied to claw, which draws the milk from the udder. Flow meter determines amount of milk being produced by cow

--- Slide 44 ---
The Milking Process

--- Slide 45 ---
The Milking Process
5. When milk stops, flow meter reads 0 milk intake and milking claw falls off automatically

--- Slide 46 ---
The Milking Process
6. Each teat is then dipped in Iodine to prevent bacterial invasion
Total time: 7 minutes

--- Slide 47 ---
The Milking Process

--- Slide 48 ---
Let’s Practice!
Milking Lab
Gloves, Cotton Balls
What does the glove represent?
What does the cotton ball represent?
Why is this an accurate representation for milking?
Why might this NOT be an accurate representation for milking?

--- Slide 49 ---
Now What?
Milk from all cows is collected into a large vat (holding container)
Normally underground to protect from extreme temperatures
Milk is transferred to a transport truck and taken to the processing plant.

--- Slide 50 ---
Milk Processing Procedures
Read your Article
Answer your Questions
Make a graphic organizer outlining the milking process

Parasites and Diseases


--- Slide 52 ---
Warm-up
What does this explain?


--- Slide 53 ---
Lesson Essential Question
How can disease influence the dairy industry?


--- Slide 54 ---
Mastitis
Infection and inflammation of the udder
Causes greatest economic loss to the industry 
Acute-hot, swollen udder-drop in milk production
Treated with antibiotics

--- Slide 55 ---
Ketosis
Metabolic disorder with a negative energy balance
Caused by underfeeding, stress, other infections
Treated by IV of glucose injections

--- Slide 56 ---
Displaced Abomasum
“twisted stomach” 
When abomasum moves to an abnormal position
Caused by feeding too much silage or concentrate before calving
Veterinarian consulted for treatment

--- Slide 57 ---
Milk Fever
Imbalance of calcium 
muscle paralysis and prevents cows from standing
 calcium and phosphorus supplements to prevent
Treated with infusion of calcium salts

--- Slide 58 ---
Retained Placenta
Placenta not expelled after birth
Quickly become infected
Vet remove or allow it to hang and it will release
Caused by heat stress, low vitamin E, and selenium in bloodstream

--- Slide 59 ---
Metritis
Resulting infection of a retained placenta
Abnormal discharge from vulva, go off feed, and stand with backs arched
Antibiotics treat

--- Slide 60 ---
Prolapsed Uterus
Uterus muscles become weak during parturition process (birthing)
Uterus flips inside out 
Uterus exits the animal
If this happens multiple times, the animal will be culled (kicked out of the herd)

--- Slide 61 ---

Work in groups
Use your article reading to complete the questions in your packet
