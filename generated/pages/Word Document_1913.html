<pre>Forensic Linguistics

Introduction 

It is the systematic study or analysis of written or recorded media in order to solve criminal or forensic concerns .Forensics experts use different aspects of the voice in order to get important facts out of them , with them voice analysis .

During voice analysis , the stress of the voice is  checked through capturing and filter out micro tremors , which in speech recognition are unique to an individual person .Every human being has a unique way in which they project their voice .This process is similar to polygraph , but the problem here is they both cannot point out deception , despite the fact that they are being used by the federal bureau of investigation  and the central investigation unit , hence making forensic linguistics a basic necessity in the identification of criminals .

Qualitative analysis measures 

Since each individual possesses a unique voice print , it is theoretically logical to check for the acoustic counter to analyze the pitch and vowels .

If the spectrograph shows similar words , intonation and vowel placement so as to align with the suspect&#x27;s voice then it is automatically identified as him or her .

 Due to this shortcoming , some countries have sought alternative measures as compared to the use of acoustic measures , the intonation and vowels , which rely on the voice print in order to identify the culprit .It also takes on voice stress analysis , which depends on visual comparison bty the experts in order t6o preempt major concerns in forensic linguistics .

As opposed to this , countries like the United Kingdom have narrowed it to transcription of the characters in order to consider the variations that might have come from the same speaker .Which brings us to AUditory analysis .

Auditory analysis 

The main difference between auditory analysis and acoustic analysis is , phonetic transcription allows for idiosyncratic analysis that allows for identification of speech impediments and the realization of phonemes which is not possible for acoustic analysis which relies on what can be seen .</pre>
