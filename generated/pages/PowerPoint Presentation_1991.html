Networks
By the end of this session, you will:
 Define and describe a LAN and WAN.
 Understand the hardware required.
 Know the 3 LAN topologies.

--- Slide 2 ---
Networks
 What is a Network?
 What is a LAN? What hardware do you need to make one?
 What is a WAN? What hardware do you need to make one?
 What are the advantages and disadvantages of a network?
 Draw a star, ring and bus network – give advantages and disadvantages of each.





--- Slide 3 ---
Networks
A network is two or more computers connected so that they can communicate with each other.  
There are 2 main types of network… LAN and WAN

--- Slide 4 ---
Network Topologies
There are 4 main types of network topologies:
The Ring Network
The Bus Network
The Star Network
The Tree Network

--- Slide 5 ---
Network Topologies
The Ring Network:
Computers are connected together to form a ring shape so that none of them is more important than any of the others.

--- Slide 6 ---
Network Topologies
The Ring Network:
Advantages:
They are cheap to expand.
The data flows around the network in one direction so it is fast
There is no reliance on a central computer.
Disadvantages:
If there are a lot of users on the network, it could slow down as all the data is sent along a single line.
If one computer in the ring stops working, the whole network stops.

--- Slide 7 ---
Network Topologies
The Bus (or line) Network:
Computers are connected like bus stops on a main road. None of them is more important than any of the others; has terminators to prevent signal bounce.

--- Slide 8 ---
Network Topologies
The Bus (Line) Network:
Advantages:
It is cheap as it uses the least amount of cable.
More computers can be added without disruption.
If one device or computer fails, it does not affect the rest of the network
Disadvantages:
With a lot of users, the network will be slow as data has to travel through the same central cable.
Failure of the central cable will stop the network from working.
It is difficult to isolate a fault in the network

--- Slide 9 ---
Network Topologies
The Star Network:
Computers are connected like a star to a central computer such as   a mainframe. This is also called the “host” computer.
                

--- Slide 10 ---
Network Topologies
The Star Network:
Advantages:
If a cable fails, it will only affect one workstation.
More computers can be added without disruption.
It is easy to identify problems on the network
Disadvantages:
It is more expensive as it uses the most cabling.
Failure of the central computer will stop the network from working.

--- Slide 11 ---
COMMON TYPES OF SERVERS
Most networks are controlled by servers.
	-File server- for saving and loading files
	-Application servers- distributes application software to each computer
	-Printer servers- to connect users to a printer.
	-Proxy servers- used as a buffers between a WAN and a LAN

--- Slide 12 ---
Networks: LANs
LAN stands for: 
LOCAL AREA NETWORK
LANs are networks that are found where computers within a building need to communicate.
They are Small and Local!

--- Slide 13 ---
Networks: LANs
File Server : Runs software, stores files.
Terminals : Workstations that give network access.
Print Server : Queues up all print jobs from users in network.
Cables (wire/optic) : Sends data.
The above are connected to hubs/switches then to routers/modems which then connect the LAN to the internet.
What hardware do you need for a LAN network?

--- Slide 14 ---
Networks: WANs
WAN stands for: 
WIDE AREA NETWORK
WANs are networks that are found where computers in different areas or countries need to communicate.
They are long range and not local!

--- Slide 15 ---
Networks: WANs
What extra hardware do you need for a WAN network?
Modems : To connect up to a telephone system (instead of cable);router.
How a modem works…

--- Slide 16 ---
Networks: Ad/Disad
Some advantages of a network are:
 Resources (Hardware and Software) can be shared.
 Allows more effective communication between users e.g. via e-mail.
 Networks are cheaper than “stand-alone PCs.”
 Information held on the network can be accessed by all users with authorised access.


--- Slide 17 ---
Networks: Ad/Disad
Some disadvantages of a network are:
 The set-up and maintenance costs can be expensive.
 A fault with the network server can cause difficulties with the organisation.
 Networks need security measures to restrict access to users.
 WANs are vulnerable to hackers and viruses.
Development of printer queues
Slower access to external networks such as the internet


--- Slide 18 ---
Are similar to LANs but there are no wires or cables. 
They provide wireless communication over fairly short distances using radio or infrared signals. 
They make use of Access Points (APs). 
APs use either spread spectrum technology (which is a wideband radio frequency with a range of about 30 to 50 metres) or infrared (with a frequency of about 1 to 2 metres – easily blocked, short range and of a limited use).
Wireless LANs (WLANS)

--- Slide 19 ---
Advantages of WLAN
Since cables are not used, there is more safety
All computers can access the same services and resources within the network. Such resources include printers, scanners etc.
Users do not have to sit in the same position, they can move with their laptops.
It is easy to add a new computer and devices to the network.


--- Slide 20 ---
Disadvantages
Security is an issue since anyone can join your network unless it is secured.
The data transfer rate is slower than a wired LAN.
There may be signal interference which may affect the network reception.


--- Slide 21 ---
WiFi
This is any system where it is possible to connect to a network or to a single computer through wireless communications.
Examples:
Within a WLAN
Using PDAs and other handheld devices
Laptop which are WiFi enabled
Peripheral devices such as printers, keyboard and mouse which can interface with the single computer when fitted with WiFi adapters.


--- Slide 22 ---
WiFi Hotspot 
What is a WiFi hotspot? 
These are places where you can access WiFi free or paid. They are usually found in public places such as airports, hotels.
War driving is driving around in a car looking for unsecured WiFi hotspots.
 


--- Slide 23 ---
Bluetooth
Bluetooth is an example of WPAN technology.
With Bluetooth in devices such as Laptops, Mobile phones, media player and printer, one can form a network within a range of 10metres. 
This is a mini LAN because one can transfer photographs from a digital camera to a mobile phone or the transfer of phone details to a computer.


--- Slide 24 ---
Wide Area Network(WAN)
This is basically formed by a number of LANs being connected together through either a router or  a modem.

An ISP is required to connect the network to the internet and to communicate via the network system.


--- Slide 26 ---
NETWORK DEVICES
Network hubs
Switches
Bridges
Modems
Routers
Proxy servers

--- Slide 27 ---
Network Devices
1. Modems
Modem means modulator demodulator. 
It is a device which converts a computer’s digital signal(i.e modulates it) into an analogue signal for transmission over an existing telephone line. 
It also does the reverse process, in that it converts analogue signals from a telephone line into digital  signals (demodulates) to enable the computer to process the data.

--- Slide 28 ---
2. Network Hub
This is a device which can have a number of computers or other devices connected to it in a network. It has up to 16 ports
Its function is to take any data received via one of the ports and send out this data to all the ports.
Each computer or device will then receive the data whether it is relevant to them or not.


--- Slide 29 ---
3. Switches
Sometimes known as switched hubs.
A switch has up to 24 ports. It learns which device is connected to which port
It is sends data to only the device or computer that is meant to receive it and not any other. 
It uses MAC addresses to uniquely identify different devices on the network
A switch is more efficient than a hub. 

--- Slide 30 ---
 These devices connect one LAN to another LAN that uses the same PROTOCOL (the rules that govern the format and the way data is transmitted)
 The bridge examines each message and determines if the message was sent to someone within the same LAN or to someone on a different LAN
 Workstation addresses are not specific to their location so messages are sent out to every work station on the network
4. Bridges

--- Slide 31 ---
Segment A
Segment B

--- Slide 32 ---
5.Routers
These are devices that connect LANs together within one organisation and also connect them to the internet. 
This is usually within a large organisation which has more than one LAN which needs to be linked together to share files or communicate.
Since every computer on the same network has the same first part of an IP address (INTERNET PROTOCOL), it is able to send data to appropriate switch which then uses the mac address to deliver the data packet to the correct computer


--- Slide 33 ---
Using a Router
to determine
which route to 
send the
Message.

--- Slide 34 ---
Http proxy servers
  This is a special type of server that acts as a buffer(temporary storage place) between a WAN(usually the internet) and LAN.
  If a user requests a certain internet page, the server passes this request to the internet(WAN). Once retrieved, the page is then passed on to the user who requested it. 
This page is then saved on the server and anyone requesting the same will find it faster to retrieve it.

--- Slide 36 ---
The internet
This is a worldwide collection of networks which allows a subscriber to send and receive emails, chat(using text or voice) or browse the world wide web.
The www is the part of the internet which the user can access by way of a web browser.
A web browser is a software that allows the user to display and interact with pages and files from the web.

--- Slide 37 ---
Websites
A website is made up of many web pages linked together.
Web pages are docume</pre>
