File Directories and Folders
An operating system maintains a directory for each disk, tape, CD, DVD, or USB flash drive
Root directory
Subdirectory
Depicted as folders
A computer’s file location is defined by a file specification, or path
C:\Music\Reggae\Marley One Love.mp3

--- Slide 24 ---

File Formats
Windows uses a file association list to link a file extension to its corresponding application software
Although a file extension is a good indicator of a file’s format, it does not really define the format
A file header is a section of data at the beginning of a file that contains information about a file

--- Slide 25 ---

File Formats
A software application can open files that exist in its native file format, plus several additional file formats

--- Slide 26 ---
Chapter 4: Operating Systems and File Management

File Formats
An easy way to convert a file
from one format to another is
to open it with an application
that supports both file formats,
and then use the Save As dialog
box to select an alternative
file format.

Application-based File Management
The Save As dialog box
of most Windows applications uses the
operating system’s file
management utility, so
you can carry out a wide
variety of file and folder
tasks such as creating,
renaming, and deleting
files.

Physical File Storage
The physical storage model describes what happens on the disks and in the circuits when files are stored
Storage media must be formatted before it can store files
Formatting utilities divide the disk into tracks and sectors

--- Slide 37 ---
Chapter 4: Operating Systems and File Management
37
Physical File Storage
CDs and DVDs can be created using mastering or packet-writing techniques. Mastering creates disks that can be used more reliably on a wide variety
of computers and standalone players. Packet writing is more flexible for disks that you plan to
use only on your own computer.

--- Slide 38 ---
Chapter 4: Operating Systems and File Management
38
Physical File Storage
The file system keeps track of the names and locations of files
NTFS
Master File Table (MFT)
FAT32
File Allocation Table (FAT)

--- Slide 39 ---
Chapter 4: Operating Systems and File Management
39
Physical File Storage
Deleting a file changes the status of that file’s clusters to empty and removes the file name from the index file
The file’s data is still there
File shredder software overwrites “empty” sectors with random 1s and 0s
Files in the Windows Recycle Bin and similar utilities can be undeleted


--- Slide 40 ---
Chapter 4: Operating Systems and File Management

Backup Basics
Your backup schedule depends on how much data you can afford to lose
You should run an up-to-date virus check as the first step in your backup routine
The backup device you select depends on the value of your data, your current equipment, and your budget
