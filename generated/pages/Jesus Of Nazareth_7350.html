Jesus Of Nazareth
Jesus The Christ

--- Slide 2 ---
INRIIesus Nazarenus Rex JudeorumJesus of Nazareth King of the Jews

--- Slide 3 ---
Chi-RoGreek for Christos

--- Slide 4 ---
The Incarnation

--- Slide 5 ---
The IncarnationThe Reason for The Season Baby!
Literally means to “take on flesh”
The belief that God’s eternal Son took on human nature and became man in Jesus of Nazareth to save us from our sins
“God with skin on”
South American tribe story


--- Slide 6 ---
The Incarnation: Why?Four Reasons:
To save us from sin, death, and eternal separation from God
So that we could know God’s true nature and his love for us
To be our role model of how we should live. Ex. WWJD?
To make us sharers in God’s life

--- Slide 7 ---
Apostles Creed
I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord, who was conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit and born of the Virgin Mary.

--- Slide 8 ---
Jesus: the Name
From the Hebrew word Yehoshua or Joshua
It means God saves or saviour
A common name
This name was given Mary by the angel Gabriel
From conception God had destined that Jesus would save the world from sin and death
What does your name mean?

--- Slide 9 ---
Saviour

--- Slide 10 ---
The Christ: Messiah
The Hebrew word Masiah translates to the Greek word Christos which literally means “anointed one.”
Was first applied to the king of Israel, God’s anointed leader
Throughout history the Jews believed that God would send a king who would represent Yahweh’s love and care for his people

--- Slide 11 ---
What kind of Messiah was expected?
Most Jews expected a political and military leader who would lead Israel to a great military victory and re-establish Israel as an independent nation
Many Jews expected the coming of the Messiah to be accompanied by an apocalyptic event (dramatic)

--- Slide 12 ---
The Messiah

--- Slide 13 ---
Suffering Servant
Jesus baffled many of the common expectations for the Messiah being a conquering earthly leader
He chose to be a suffering servant who took on the sins of his people
He was truly a man of the people, a model for ultimate leadership
“The Son of Man did not come to be served but to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many” (Matthew 20:28)

--- Slide 14 ---
The Son of Man
Jesus often used this title. It comes from an Old Testament vision in which Daniel the prophet saw “… one like a son of man coming out on the clouds of heaven.”
The title had two purposes:
To emphasize his connection with humanity
To reveal his role as the judge who will establish his kingdom at the end of time


--- Slide 15 ---
The Return of the King

--- Slide 16 ---
Son of God
Both at his baptism and transfiguration the Father calls Jesus his “beloved Son”
Jesus says “The Father and I are one” Jn.10:36
Humans are adopted children not genetic children of God
Jesus had God’s DNA


--- Slide 17 ---
God’s DNA

--- Slide 18 ---
Lord
Like sir when referring to someone who is  a ruler or in power over you
Term referring to authority and divinity
Yahweh “I am”
He is God
Through miracles and resurrection Jesus proves his Divinity

--- Slide 19 ---
Guru or Master
Lord can also mean master or guru 
Disciple means learner, Jesus is the teacher or master as in martial arts
Jesus is the master/guru/sensei of living
Guru (Sanskrit: गुरु), is a term denoting a teacher or guide in the religious or spiritual sense 
The disciples believed that Jesus’ way of living was higher and more brilliant than that of the other groups of their time so they felt lured to Jesus’ way. 


--- Slide 20 ---
Jesus a Guru/Sensai?

--- Slide 21 ---
Did He Really Exist?
There are books written about him
Some of these were written by non-believers like the Roman historian Tacitus or the Jewish historian Josephus
Most of what we know about him comes from writings left by his followers in what we call the New Testament

--- Slide 22 ---
The New Testament
Jesus is the New Testament or New Covenant with all humanity.
Jesus taught three main things using parables or short stories:
God is Abba Father and longs to be close to us
God’s kingdom is in our midst
That we should love our enemies

--- Slide 23 ---
The Formation of the Gospels
Gospel means “good news”
There are 4 Gospels: Mt, Mk, Lk, Jn
There were 3 stages of formation:
The Historical Jesus: 4/6BC-30/33AD
Oral Tradition: 30/33-50AD
The New Testament Writings: 50-120 AD

--- Slide 24 ---

Jesus’ Early Life

His family later moved back to Nazareth where he grew up and learned carpentry
He would make visits to the Temple in Jerusalem every year with his parents

Jesus’ Public Life:Baptism
Began at his baptism by John the Baptist
Jesus launched his mission to be God’s suffering servant
John said, “Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world”
God said, “That’s my boy!”


--- Slide 30 ---
Jesus’ Public Life:The Kingdom of God
Is God’s power and active presence, his saving activity on the earth
Jesus’ miracles of healing the spiritual, physical, and psychological illness are signs  of his kingdom
Jesus taught that one day his kingdom will slowly transform all of humanity 
A revolution of love
Like a little bit of chocolate syrup in a glass of milk
This began to spread with his first followers
Clip from Jesus of Nazareth

--- Slide 31 ---
Kingdom of God like syrup?!

--- Slide 32 ---
The First Followers of Jesus
Andrew – follower of John the Baptist, Peter’s brother
Philip – follower of John the Baptist
Matthew – tax collector
Thomas – servant, known for doubting
Peter – fishermen, Andrew’s brother
Judas – scholar, money keeper
Mary – prostitute, business women
Simon – Zealot, converted to Jesus’ group
Nicodemus – Pharisee, followed Jesus, secretly
Joseph of Arimethea – Pharisee, followed Jesus secretly

--- Slide 33 ---
Jesus’ Public Life:Death
Jesus’ death was a redemption, a ransom. 
He took on our guilt by substituting for us, by dying a death we deserve
He did this to buy our freedom with his eternal, divine love
This opened the whole world to God’s presence (the tearing of the temple curtain) 
Story of the gang member and his brother
Who killed Jesus?
Story We Find Ourselves In ch.20 windows

--- Slide 35 ---
Resurrection

--- Slide 36 ---
Reflection…
The whole world is upside down. The Jewish people, who should be the most prosperous and triumphant, are at the bottom of the heap, with the idolatrous and immoral Romans over them. And then Jesus, who seems so good and right and compassionate, promises a better way, but he gets betrayed and snuffed out. So the bad guys completely and utterly win. It’s tragic. It’s as if Jesus ignites this glimmer of hope of something up on that higher level and how the hope is smashed under the heel of Caesar’s violence…

--- Slide 37 ---
Reflection…
And then comes the sign and wonder of the resurrection… And that would mean that even if the worst things happen, even if the worst people remain in power and the best people are killed, don’t be afraid, because God is going to triumph; and Jesus’ approach, his nonviolence, his compassion, his higher perspective—it’s all validated after all. God’s revolution can be resisted, but never defeated. (p.123)


--- Slide 38 ---
Reflection…
OK, Kerry, and if you believe that, then how are you going to live?
Well, you’ll want to do right, no matter what the odds, and you’ll keep loving and refusing to hate. And you’ll… you’ll trust God no matter what happens, because even though God’s power seems weak—weak enough to be betrayed and tortured and killed—it rises again and promises to win in the end. (p.124)


--- Slide 39 ---
Jesus’ Public Life:Resurrection
The resurrection of Jesus was a real historical event
His tomb was empty and he appeared to many of the disciples
You can’t find his grave today though some claim it is around along with many other claims since then (p59)
He didn’t really die, his body was stolen, it is a metaphor, etc.



--- Slide 40 ---
Why is it Important?
What do you think?
It proves Jesus’ divinity and that he is not a liar (he said he would rise)
Jesus’ resurrection proves that there is life after death and that we will get our bodies back
Jesus is no longer limited to space and time and can meet us in prayer, in the Eucharist, and in the poor.
Last point from reflection…
