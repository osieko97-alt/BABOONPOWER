<pre>--- Slide 1 ---
Prehistory, the Neolithic Revolution, and River Civilizations

--- Slide 2 ---
BIG PICTURE: Development of agriculture a MAJOR CHANGE in human history.  Most societies were agricultural.  Still a clash between industrialized world and agricultural patterns.

--- Slide 3 ---
I. Human Evolution
Emergence of humans 2.5 million BCE – 9,000 BCE – Hunter - Gatherers
Earliest versions of humans from East Africa (Olduvai Gorge) 
Use of tools and domestication of animals
Homo sapiens sapiens (H.s.s.) – 120,000 years ago
Migration around the world – resources
25,000 BCE – H.s.s. spread around the world (few exceptions)





--- Slide 5 ---
Early Human Sites

--- Slide 6 ---
II. Neolithic (Agricultural) Revolution
People spread out and formed distinct cultures based on their environment
10,000 – 9,000 BCE – 5 – 10 million people
H.s.s. coexisted with other species (Neanderthals) but eventually triumphed over them
Development of Agriculture and Industrial Revolution – two MAJOR changes


--- Slide 7 ---
Agricultural Roots

--- Slide 8 ---
	III. Changes from Neolithic Revolution
5000 BCE – agriculture common but slow – disadvantages
Few contacts among far – flung population
Environment not suitable (desert, heavy forest)
Success of nomadic herding in some regions
Staying in one place…waiting…
GREATER WORK LOAD

--- Slide 9 ---
Gender relations changed – patriarchal societies
Higher birthrate necessary
Men primary cultivators
Inequalities between men/women
Settled, clustered groups at higher risk of disease
Altered local environments (slash and burn)
 INCREASE IN FOOD SUPPLY RESULTED IN INCREASED POPULATION
Agricultural societies – 80/20
Spring and divine creation
Surpluses - pottery

--- Slide 10 ---
WHY?
Why would perfectly happy and healthy hunter-gatherers have settled down to be farmers?  What processes encouraged this transition?
How do periods of cold and warm weather affect human development?



--- Slide 11 ---
 IV. Early Civilizations
Why Rivers?
Agriculture- dependable water supply
	AND stuff already grows there
Domesticated animals
Ability to settle
More temperate climate
Irrigation possible- plays a big role in emergence of civilizations 


--- Slide 12 ---
A. Mesopotamia
First “civilization”= Sumeria, 5,000 BCE
Tigris &amp; Euphrates – large agricultural surplus
Later, Akkad (empire 2340 BCE), Babylon (early 2nd millenium BCE)
Used bronze – improved military, required long distance trade
Wheel (Central Asian nomads)





--- Slide 13 ---
Mesopotamian firsts
First because:
Writing - cuneiform (long distance comm., trade, knowledge passed on)
City-states, formal/structured government
Monumental architecture (ziggurat) 
Military strategies and armor 
Irrigation (need rules to regulate)
Not first, but remembered for:
Law code of Hammurabi (c. 1750 BCE)


--- Slide 14 ---
Mesopotamia

--- Slide 16 ---
B. EGYPT- Gift of the Nile
MIGRATION ~5000 BCE to Nile- ran out of water in Sahara
Civilization emerged 3000 BCE
Nile – very regular, viewed as a benevolent god
Made Egypt hugely productive
Creation myths – flood cycle
5X the area of France, 6M years old



--- Slide 17 ---
Increasing population needs greater political organization
Larger % of pop. lived in farming villages than cities
Ethnically diverse
Less stark social divisions than Mesopotamia
Women had more mobility (esp. upper class)

--- Slide 18 ---
Social Pyramid
PHAROAH
PRIESTS
NOBLES
MERCHANTS/ARTISANS
PEASANTS
SLAVES

--- Slide 19 ---
Politics
 Three major periods: 
OLD KINGDOM  2700 B.C. to 2200 B.C.
MIDDLE KINGDOM  2050 B.C. to 1652 B.C.
NEW KINGDOM  1532 B.C. to 1070 B.C. (height)

Major rulers:
Old Kingdom:  Narmer (Menes), Khufu, Khafra, Menkure
New Kingdom:  Ramses II, Hatshepsut, Akhenaten


--- Slide 20 ---
Religion
Re (Sun god), Osiris, Isis - reincarnation (Egyptian Book of the Dead) – Papyrus
Pharoahs divine (Horus)
Pyramids, mummies – postmortem judgment
Gods of conquered territories incorporated




--- Slide 21 ---
Hieroglyphs
Written script	
Spoken language
  Hieroglyphic pictograms can be read in up to three different ways:
they can represent exactly what they look like
they can represent an idea (i.e. son of), or
they can represent a sound (sa)

--- Slide 23 ---
C. INDUS VALLEY
2500 BCE – Major cities Harappa and Mohenjo – Dara (now underwater) 
Written language (still uncoded) – lots of Qs
Architecture indicates strong central authority
Indus River was very unpredictable- flooded the cities frequently, also frequent monsoons
Trade with north and west – tools/stones of high quality/value
Fell before the invasions of Indo – Europeans (natural disaster? “systems failure”?)
