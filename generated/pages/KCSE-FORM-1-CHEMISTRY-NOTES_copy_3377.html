 (A) STATES/PHASES OF MATTER 
Matter is anything that has weight/ mass  and occupies space/ volume. Naturally, there 
are basically three  states of matter. 
 
 (i) Solid -e.g. soil, sand, copper metal ,bucket, ice. 
 (ii) Liquid- e.g water, Petrol, ethanol/alcohol, Mercury(liquid metal). 
   (iii) gas- e.g. Oxygen, Nitrogen ,Water vapour. 
 
 
Solids 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Have closely packed particles 
 Have definite shape and volume 
 Have particles that vibrate about fixed positions    


 When heated, particles vibrate more vigorously, bonds weaken, particles space 
out and solid expands. 
 Liquids  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Liquids: 
 Flow freely because their particles slide over each other as they have weak 
interparticle forces. 
 Have no definite shape 
 Have definite volume cannot be squashed 
 Can flow because interparticle forces between liquid particles are weak and so the 
particles can slide over/past each other. 
 
Gases  
  
Gases 
 
 
 
 
 
Gases; 
 Offer least resistance 
 Occupy greater volume than same mass of solids/liquids 
 Have particles that are widely spaced apart (weak interparticle forces) and move 
with great speed 

 No fixed volume, no fixed shape 
 Are only restricted by shape and size of /container 
 Particles are far apart and can be pushed together (can be easily compressed) 
 Move around easily, quickly and randomly colliding with each other and bounce 
off, spacing out.

(b) Separation of mixture 
A mixture is a combination of two or more substances that can be separated by physical 
means. Simple methods of separating mixtures at basic chemistry level include 
(i)Sorting/picking -this involve physically picking one pure substance from a mixture 
with another/other. e. g. sorting maize from maize beans mixture. 
 
(ii)Decantation -this involve pouring out a liquid from a solid that has settled /sinking 
solid in it. e. g. Decanting water form sand  . 

 
 
(iii)Filtration -this involves sieving /passing particles of a mixture through a filter 
containing small holes that allow smaller particle to pass through but do not allow 
bigger particle to pass through. 


 
 
(iv)Skimming -this involve scooping floating particles. e.g. cream from milk 
 
(c) Metals and non-metals 
Metals are shiny, ductile(able to form wires),malleable(able to form sheet) and coil 
without breaking. e.g. Iron, gold, silver, copper. Mercury is the only liquid metal  
known. 
 Non-metals are dull, not ductile(do not form wires), not malleable(do not form sheet) 
and break on coiling/brittle. e.g. Charcoal,  Sulphur , plastics. 
 
CONDUCTORS AND INSULATORS 
Conductors  are made of materials that electricity can flow through easily. 
These materials are made up of atoms whose electrons can move away freely. 
 
 


                    
 
Some examples of conductors are: 
 All metals (molten or solid) and the non-metal carbon (graphite). This conduction involves 
the movement of free or delocalized electrons (e- charged particles) and does not involve 
any chemical change.  
 Any molten or dissolved material in which the liquid contains free moving ions is call ed 
the electrolyte. Ions are charged particles eg Na+ sodium ion, or Cl- chloride ion, and their 
movement or flow constitutes an electric current, because a current is moving charged 
particles. 
List of conductors 
 Copper 
 Aluminum 
 Platinum 
 Gold 
 Silver 
 Graphite 
 Salt solutions (e.g. sodium chloride) 
 Water 
 People and Animals 
 Trees 
Insulators  are materials opposite of conductors. The atoms are not easily freed and are 
stable, preventing or blocking the flow of electricity. 
Some examples of insulators are: 
 Glass 


 Porcelain 
 Plastic 
 Rubber 
Electricity will always take the shortest path to the ground. Your body is 60% water and 
that makes you a good conductor  of electricity. If a power line has fallen on a tree and 
you touch the tree you become the path or conductor to the ground and could get 
electrocuted. 
The rubber or plastic on an electrical cord provides an insulator  for the wires. By 
covering the wires, the electricity cannot go through the rubber and is forced to follow 
the path on the aluminum or copper wires. 
 
 
The ability to conduct electricity is the major simple distinction between elements that 
are metals and non-metals. 
(e)Drugs 
 


A drug is a natural or synthetic/man-made substance that when taken changes/alter 
the body functioning. A natural or synthetic/man-made substance that when taken 
changes/alter the abnormal body functioning to normal is called medicine . 
Medicines are thus drugs intended to correct abnormal body functions. . Medicines 
should therefore be taken on prescription  and dosage .  
A prescription is a medical instruction to a patient/sick on the correct  type of 
medicine to take and period/time   between one intake to the other .  
A dosage is the correct quantity of drug required to alter the abnormal body 
function back to normal. This is called treatment . 
 It is the professional work of qualified doctors/pharmacists to adm inister correct 
prescription and dosage of drugs/medicine to the sick. 
Prescription and dosage of drugs/medicine to the sick  use medical language. 
 Example 
   (i) 2  x  4 ;  means “2” tablets for solid  drugs/spoon fulls for liquid  drugs 
taken “4” times  for a duration of one day/24 hours  and then repeated and 
continued until all the drug given is finished. 
 (ii) 1  x  2 ;  means “1” tablets for solid  drugs/spoon fulls for liquid  drug s 
taken “2” times  for a duration of one day/24 hours  and then repeated and 
continued until all the drug given is finished. 
Some drugs need minimal prescription and thus are available without pharmacist/ 
doctor ’s prescription. They are called Over The Counter(OTC) drugs. OTC drugs 
used to treat mild headaches, stomach upsets, common cold include: 
 (i) painkillers 
 (ii) anti acids 
 (iii) cold/flu drugs. 
All medicines require correct intake dosage. When a prescription dosage is not 
followed, this is called drug misuse/abuse.   
Some drugs are used for other purposes other than that intended. This is  called 
drug abuse . 
 Drug abuse is when a drug is intentionally used to alter the normal funct ioning of 
the body. The intentional abnormal function of the drug is to make the v ictim have 
false feeling of well being.  
The victim lack both mental and physical coordination.  
Some drugs that induce a false feeling of well being are illegal. They include 
heroin, cocaine, bhang, mandrax and morphine. 
Some abused drugs which are not illegal include: miraa, alcohol, tobacco, slee ping 
pills. 
 
 

1.2.2 CHEMISTRY AND THE SOCIETY 
• Definition of chemistry and its role in the society  
Chemistry is a branch of Science. Science is basically the study of living and non-
living things. The branch of science that study living things is called Bio logy. The 
branch of science that study non-living things is called Physical Science. Phy sical 
Science is made up of: 
 (i)Physics- the study of matter in relation to energy 
 (ii)Chemistry- the study of composition of matter. 
 
Chemistry is thus defined as the branch of science that deals with the stru cture 
composition, properties and behavior of matter. 
Basic Chemistry involves studying: 
The role of chemistry in society 
 
(a)Chemistry is used in the following: 
(i)Washing/cleaning with soap: 
Washing/cleaning is a chemical process  that involve jnteraction of water,soa p and 
dirt so as to remove the dirt from a garment. 
 
(ii)Understanding chemicals of life 
Living thing grow, respire and feed. The formation and growth of cells i nvolve 
chemical processes in living things using carbohydrates, proteins and vitam ins.  
 
(iii)Baking: 
Adding baking powder to dough and then heating in an oven involves  interactions 
that require understanding of chemistry.  
 
 (iv)Medicine: 
Discovery, test ,prescription and dosage of drugs to be used for medic inal purposes 
require advanced understanding of chemistry 
 (v)Fractional distillation of crude oil: 
 Crude oil is fractional distilled to useful portions like petrol,di esel,kerosene by 
applying chemistry. 
  
(vi)Manufacture of synthetic compounds/substances 
Large amounts of plastics, glass, fertilizers, insecticides, soaps , cements, are 
manufactured worldwide. Advanced understanding of the chemical processes 
involved is a requirement. 

 
(vii)Diagnosis/test for abnormal body functions. 
If the body is not functioning normally,it is said to be sick/ill.Laboaratory test are 
done to diagnose the illness/sickness. 
  
(b)The following career fields require Chemistry as one of subject areas of 
advanced/specialized study: 
(i)Chemical engineering/chemica</pre>
