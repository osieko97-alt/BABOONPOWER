Fungus / Bacteria
Cankers (fungus or bacteria)
Cankers are localized dead areas of bark in trees and shrubs caused by fungi and bacterial infection. They cause destructive tree diseases. Bark damage helps infection to start. 
Can kill trees in a short time.
No cure.

Fungus / Bacteria
They can be caused by mechanical damage (especially weed whips and lawn mowers), environmental conditions (frost cracks, sunscald),chemical injury, insects, or micro-organisms (fungi and bacteria).

Fungus
Spread by splashing water. Wet heat is ideal.
Septoria leaf spot, sometimes called Septoria blight, appears on the lower leaves after the first fruits set. Fruits are not infected. Leaf loss reduces fruit yield and quality, and exposing fruits to sunscald. The fungus is spread by splashing water and by working among the plants when they are wet.

Fungus
Localized infections on leaves; requires moisture.
Can cause premature defoliation, reduced plant vigor, and increases susceptibility to other diseases and environmental stresses.
Remove plant debris each fall.
Leafspot (fungus or bacteria)

--- Slide 16 ---
The centers of the spots are gray/tan and have a dark brown margin In the center of the spots are many dark brown, pimple-like bodies of the fungus. The structures are large enough to be seen with the unaided eye or with the aid of a hand lens. Spots may also appear on stems, calyxes, and blossoms, but rarely on fruit. Heavily infected leaves will turn yellow, dry up, and drop off. This will result in sunscalding of the fruit.

Fungus
Three kinds: Septoria leaf spot, early blight and late blight 
All spread by splashing water. Wet heat is ideal.
Early blight, appears on the lower leaves, usually after a heavy fruit set. The spots are dark brown to black. Concentric rings develop in the spot forming a bull’s eye. The leaf area around each target spot turns yellow, and soon the entire leaf turns yellow and drops. Early blight also infects stems and may produce stem cankers. It occasionally attacks the fruit, producing large sunken black target spots on the stem end of the fruit. Infected fruits often drop before they mature. This disease is most common late in the growing season. 
Late blight occurs in moist weather with cool nights and moderately warm days. Dark-green to nearly black wet-looking spots begin spreading in from the leaf edge. In wet weather, the spots may have a downy, white growth on the lower leaf surface near the outer portion of the spot. Spots also develop on the fruits. At first, the spots are gray-green and water-soaked, but they soon enlarge and turn dark brown and firm, with a rough surface. 
All overwinter on tomato and weed refuse. Remove dead debris. Rotate crops.
Blight 

--- Slide 20 ---
Fungus
Lesions are on lower, older leaves The lesions are dark brown and appear leathery with faint, concentric rings giving a &quot;target-spot&quot; effect. At first the spots are small (1 /8&quot; in diameter), but later the spots can enlarge to about 1/2&quot;. In many cases they are bounded by the larger leaf veins At harvest time, spores from blighted vines may be deposited onto tubers. These spores germinate during wet and warm weather and invade the tissue, primarily through cuts, bruises, or wounded surfaces.
Tuber infections appear as generally small, irregular, brownish—black spots which are usually slightly sunken (approx. 1/16&quot;) Externally the spots resemble those caused by late blight, but internally they are shallower and darker in color. The rotted tuber tissue is firm, hard, and somewhat corky. EB tuber rot develops slowly and may not be severe until quite late into the storage period. This decay may allow the entry of secondary organisms soft rot bacteria.

Early Blight

Potato
Fungus

--- Slide 22 ---
Fungus
Tomatoes and potatoes (Irish potato famine).
Survives only on old potato tubers. Can travel through the air. Plant only sound, blemish free tubers. Don&#x27;t allow any discarded tubers to sprout the next year. 
Wet, hot weather favors spread.

Late Blight Symptoms
Infected potatoes have shallow, brownish or purplish lesions on the surface. If you cut across the surface of these infected areas, you&#x27;ll see a reddish-brown, dry, granular rot that extends up to half an inch into the flesh. 
On potato plants: Lesions occur on both leaves and stems, commonly after periods of wet weather. Black lesions, whitish fungal spores are produced at the edge of the lesion, particularly on the underside of the leaf. Lesions turn brown when dried and are often surrounded by a halo of gray-green tissue. On stems, late blight causes brown, greasy looking lesions that frequently appear first at the junction between the stem and leaf, or at the cluster of leaves at the top of the stem.
