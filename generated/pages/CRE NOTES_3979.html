CREATION  
 
 
 
Origin of sin and its consequences   
(Gen: 3 -11)  
 
 
Introduction  
Man and woman fell from the Garden of Eden. This experience is expla -ined in 
genesis chapter 3 verse 4; chapter 6 verse 9 and chapter 11. In these verses, the Bible 
is teaching about sin, which made Adam and Eve fall.  
Sin is defined as iniquity, and guilt . It is to miss a mark, to transgress. Sin is a 
rebellion or an offence against God. Sin originated with the disobedience of Adam 
and Eve. They had been commanded not to eat of the fruits of the tree of knowledge 
of good and evil – the tree in the middle o f the Garden of Eden. But Adam and Eve 
ate the fruit after being deceived by the serpent.  
Man had the power to resist temptation but instead he yielded. Genesis Chapter 3 
verse 6 states that man wanted to be wise and thought how wonderful it would be to 
become wise…” hence sin arises from the lack of knowledge of God, from the denial 
of trust of God.  
 
 


 
 
The consequences of sin  
After sinning, we the human race and sinners:  
1) Replaced friendship with God with fear of God.  
2) Lost innocence. What had be en innocent and good became shameful. Adam and 
Eve became ashamed of their nakedness, something they had never felt before they 
sinned against God.  
3) Lost good relationship with God. The good relationship between God and man 
was betrayed. Human beings – were alienated from God. “The Lord God sent him 
out of the Garden of Eden…”  
4) Damaged the perfect relationship between man and woman. The Lord said to the 
woman “You will have desire for your husband, yet you will be subject to him”.  
5) Pain became part  of human experience. “I will greatly multiply your pain in child 
bearing”.  
6) Man began toiling and struggling to meet his needs… “You will have to work 
hard and sweat to make the soil produce anything”  
7) The home of man, and the earth itself was placed under a curse. “Cursed is the 
ground because of you.”  
Enmity between man and wild animals emerged.  
9) Man began to die. Death sentence is passed upon all men. “You will return to the 
ground… you are dus t”  
10) Man began to hate. Man developed murderous feelings in his heart, for example 
Cain killed Abel, his younger brother.  
11) Man changed and became prone to sin.  
12) Life span of man was reduced (see Gen. 6:3) “I will not allow people to live 
forever , they will live no longer than 120 years”  
13) Man’s language was confused by God after the flood (read Gen.11: 7)  
14) Sin led to embarrassment, mistrust, suffering, pai n, pride, arrogance and death.  
Summary  
Disobedience of God by Adam and Eve brought serious sin consequences to human 

beings. Sin brings sadness and suffering to man even today.

CONCEPT OF EVIL  
Introduction  
In this lesson, we shall discuss the concept of evil as told by the traditi -onal African 
religion and the biblical writings. We shall study similarities and differences of evil 
from the two religions.  
What is evil?  
In the traditional African society, evi l was an offence against God, spirits and 
ancestors. It was also viewed as an offence against another person or community. 
Evil was also a misfortune that can befall an individual or a community.  
What are the causes of evil?  
Many of the traditional Afric an societies do not associate God with evil. God is not 
the creator of evil. Some communities believe that evil is an external power that 
exists on its own. Thus in the traditional African society, evil was understood or 
explained as something mysterious t hat was caused by several people and things. 
These were:  


 
 
 
 
a) Evil spirits  
b) Ancestral spirits – due to disobedience to them  
c) Some animals like the chameleon are sources of evil. The Akamba  believed that 
chameleons brought evil. Other communities believed that if an owl cries near one’s 
homestead, it is a sign of evil.  
d) People with mystical powers for example magic, sorcery, and witchcraft are evils  
e) If a member of a community breaks a  taboo by disobedience, this action may 
bring evil spirits.  
f) The spirits of the dead; cause evil; if they are not remembered or respected. Evil 
spirits cause harm and violence.  
 
Consequences of evil in traditional African society  
 These were many and r anged from (a) Barrenness (b) Drought (c) Epidemics (d) 
Madness (e) Sickness (f) Death (g) Drowning (h) Burning in a house (i) War (j) 
Physically and mentally handicapped children (l) Rebellious children  
 
 
Values  needed  to overcome  temptations   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 


 
Skills  needed  to overcome  temptations   
Recognize  Your  Tendency  to Sin 
James 1:14  explains that we are tempted when we become enticed by our own natural 
desir es. The first step toward overcoming temptation is to recognize the human tendency 
to be seduced by our own fleshly cravings.  
The temptation to sin is a given, so don&#x27;t be surprised by it. Expect to be tempted daily, 
and be prepared for it. The apostle Peter reminds us to stay on the lookout:  
Be alert and of sober mind.   
Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to 
devour.   (1 Peter 5:8, NIV)  
 
Flee From  Temptation  
But remember that the temptations that come into your life  are no different from what 
others experience. And God is faithful. He will keep the temptation from becoming so 
strong that you can&#x27;t stand up against it. When you are tempted, he will show you a way 
out so that you will not give in to it.  
When you come f ace to face with temptation, look for the way out —the way of escape —
that God has promised. Then skedaddle. Flee. Run as fast as you can.  
Resist  Temptation  with  the Word  of Truth 
Hebrews 4:12  says that God&#x27;s Word is living, active, and powerful. Did you know you 
can carry a weapon that will make your thoughts obey  Jesus Christ ? 
According to  Ephesians 6:17 , one of our weapons is the  Word of God : 
The weapons we fight with are not the weapons of the world. On the contrary, they have 
divine power to demolish strongholds. We demolish arguments and every pretension that 
sets itself up against the knowledge of God, and we take captive every thought to make it 
obedient to Christ.   (2 Corinthians 10:4 –5, NIV)  

Jesus overcame the devil&#x27;s temptations  in the wilderness wit h the Word of God. If it 
worked for him, it will work for us. And because Jesus was fully human, he is able to 
identify with our struggles and give us the exact help we need for overcoming temptation.  
While it can be helpful to read God&#x27;s Word when you&#x27;re being tempted, sometimes that&#x27;s 
not practical. Even better is to practice reading the  Bible  daily so that eventually you have 
so much of it on the inside, you are ready whenever temptation st rikes.  
If you are  reading the Bible  regularly, you will have the full counsel of God at your 
disposal. You will start to have the mind of Christ. When temptation comes knocking on 
your door, all you&#x27;ll have to do is draw your weapon, aim, and fire.  
 
Refocus  Your  Mind  and Heart  with  Praise  
How often have you been tempted to sin when your whole heart was fully concentrated 
on worshiping the Lord? I&#x27;m guessing your answer is never.  
Praising God t akes our focus off of self and puts it on God. You may not be strong 
enough to resist temptation on your own, but as you focus on God, he will inhabit your 
praises. He will give you the strength to resist and walk away from the temptation.  
Psalm 147  might be a good place to start:  
Praise the Lord. How good it is to sing praises to our God, how pleasant and fitting to 
praise him!  (Psalm 147:1, NIV)  
 
 
 
Repent  Quickly  When  You Fail 
In several places, the Bible tells us the best way to resist and overcome temptation is to 
flee from it (1 Corinthians 6:18; 1 Corinthians 10:14; 1 Timothy 6:11; 2 Timothy 2:22). 
Even still, we fall from time to time. When we fail to flee temptation, eventually we will 
give in and fall.  
Having a more realistic view —knowing that at times you will fail —should help you to 
repent quickly when you do. Failing is not the end of the world, but it is dangerous to 
persist in your sin.  

Going bac k to the book of James, verse 1:15 explains that sin &quot;when it is full -grown, 
gives birth to death.&quot; Continuing or persisting in sin leads to spiritual death, and often 
even physical death. That is why it&#x27;s best to  repent  quickly when you know you&#x27;ve fallen 
into sin  
Others include:  
1. Keep yourself busy  
2. Avoid comparison as it triggers temptations  
3. Avoid watching negative films, movies etc.  
4. Keep your mind focused and positive  
5. Seek help where  needed be  
 
God’s plan of salvation  
After the fall of man, God took steps to heal the damaged situation and relationship 
between Him and Adam and Eve.  
GOD:  
1. Provided clothing of skin to Adam and Eve.  
2. Looked for Adam and Eve since they were hiding from His presence.  
3. Provided Adam and Eve with the knowledge to find different foods.  
4. Declared enmity between man and the snake.  
5. Hinted at the ultimate victory of man when He said that the seed o f the woman 
would crush the snake or serpent’s head. The serpent would attack the heel of man 
and woman.  
All through the Old Testament, and the New Testament, we see God’s plan of 
salvation being manifested. For instance, GOD chose and separated Abraham f rom 
other communities. The children of  
Israel led by Moses (were delivered) from Egypt,. God sent prophets to teach and 
warn the Israelites of the dangers of sin. Finally God sent his only son Jesus Christ to 
die on the cross to save human kind.
