  3  	FOREWORD The Basic Education Curriculum Framework (BECF) outlines the vision and mission for the curriculum reforms. The Vision of the curriculum reforms is to develop “an engaged, an empowered and ethical citizen “while the mission is to “to nurture the potential of every learner”. The framework adopts a Competency Based Curriculum and has identified seven core competences, namely; communication and collaboration, critical thinking and problem solving, creativity and imagination, citizenship, digital literacy, learning to learn, and self-efficacy. It provides a variety of opportunities for identification and nurturing of learner’s potentials and talents in preparation for life and the world of work. It is geared towards making learning enjoyable. The curriculum designs are developed to enable implementation of the Basic Education Curriculum Framework. The design contains the National Goals of Education, outlines the Early Years Education (EYE), subject general and specific learning outcomes. It also suggests a variety of learning experiences, assessment, resources and links the topics to values, Pertinent and Contemporary Issues (PCI) and to other subjects. It is my hope that all educators in Early Years Education level will anchor their delivery of Basic and Teacher education on these Curriculum Designs.

  5  	INTRODUCTION  The Pre-primary curriculum design has been developed to embrace the competence based learning approach as stipulated in the basic education curriculum frame-work (BECF).  The curriculum design is available in two volumes which cater for children at the pre-primary level in the country. It has been divided into two levels: Level I (pre-primary 1) for children aged four years and  Level II (pre-primary 2) for children aged five years. The curriculum covers the following learning areas: Language, Mathematical, Environmental, Psychomotor and Creative and Religious Education activity areas.  Each learning activity area has both the general and specific learning outcomes clearly stipulated. The learning experiences and the key inquiry questions have also been provided specifically to give guidance to the users during the curriculum delivery process.  The curriculum has clearly identified core competences to be acquired by learners as they engage in activities in different learning areas. These core competences include: communication and collaboration, critical thinking and problem solving, imagination and creativity, citizenship, digital literacy, learning to learn and self-efficacy.   Pertinent and contemporary issues (PCIs) have been integrated into the curriculum design to prepare learners for the ever changing society specifically in order to address the changing needs of the society and ensure the learner’s safety. These include life skills development through storytelling, living values, moral values and social responsibility.    This curriculum emphasizes hands-on experiences as learners manipulate real objects and models.  Interaction with nature is also emphasized whereby learners are encouraged to observe living and non-living things in their immediate surroundings as well as during nature walk, field trips or visits to places of interest.  The curriculum emphasizes holistic development of the learner. This can be achieved by embracing the thematic integrated learning approach which is ideal for teaching learners in their formative stage of development.  The themes are derived from things and situations that learners are likely to interact with in everyday life.  Each theme is expected to cuts across all the activity areas.  Learning at the pre- primary level is expected to be flexible hence a theme may be interrupted to enable learners use an emerging situation as the learning theme for the period.
