PAPER 1
MARKING SCHEME
♦
General aspects to look for:
♦
This paper tests linguistic ability
♦
Note the following when marking:
-
Relevance in one’s content
-
Sentence connections i.e. ideas must flow smoothly from one sentence to another
-
Word connections within a given sentence
-
Correct
paragraphing:
Paragraphs
should
not
be
too
long
or
too
short
(i.e.
one
line
paragraph
unless the situation is the requirement)
-
Change of tenses anyhow. The tenses should be in line with the time one is talking about.
-
The
use
of
compound
words
-
some
are
written
as
one
word
and
others
separated
(some
students do confuse them)
-
Check on spelling mistakes
-
Credit proper use of idioms - but a student should not over use them.
Question 1
Giving directions:
-
Should be clear and vivid
-
Saying
that
he
walked
/
or
just
move
on
and
on)
is
quite
vague.
One
can
use
place
names
e.g.
after reaching Eldoret etc. or can use compass directions to direct.
-
When its in a letter form, only pay attention to how she / he gives directions.
-
Directions must be from where the parents stay to school and not vice versa
-
Must include in the directions the purpose of writing i.e. parents day.
Question 2
-
The situation being described must have something amusing i.e. social / relationship etc.
-
Start from normal situation and turn slowly into a funny one
-
Students should not talk about storage situations e.g. one swallowing spoons etc.
