<pre>12.0.0 GAS LAWS (15 LESSONS) 
(a)Gas laws 
1. Matter is made up of small particle in accordance to Kinetic Theory of matter: 
  Naturally, there are basically three  states of matter : Solid, Liquid  and gas: 
  (i)A solid is made up of particles which are very closely packed with a 
definite/fixed shape and fixed/definite volume /occupies definite space. It  has a 
very high density. 
 
  (ii) A liquid is made up of particles which have some degree of freedom. It thus 
has no definite/fixed shape. It takes the shape of the container it is p ut. A liquid has 
fixed/definite volume/occupies definite space. 
 
  (iii)A gas is made up of particles free from each other. It thus has no definite 
/fixed shape. It takes the shape of the container it is put. It has no fixed/ definite 
volume/occupies every space in a container. 
 
2.Gases  are affected by physical conditions . There are two physical conditions: 
 (i) Temperature  
 (ii) Pressure 
 
3. The SI unit of temperature is Kelvin (K). 
    Degrees  Celsius/Centigrade(oC) are also used.   
 The two units can be interconverted from the relationship: 
     oC + 273 = K 
 K -273 = oC 
 
Practice examples 
1. Convert  the following into Kelvin. 
(i) O oC 
            oC  + 273   =  K substituting : O oC  +  273  =   273 K 
 
 (ii) -273 oC 
            oC  + 273   =  K substituting :  -273oC  +  273  =  0 K 
 
(iii) 25 oC 
            oC  + 273   =  K substituting : 25 oC  +  273  =   298 K 
(iv) 100 oC 
            oC  + 273   =  K substituting : 100 oC  +  273  =   373 K 

 
2. Convert  the following into degrees Celsius/Centigrade(oC). 
(i) 10 K 
         K -273 = oC  substituting:     10   –   273   =   -263 oC 
(ii) (i) 1 K 
         K -273 = oC  substituting:     1   –   273   =  -272 oC 
 
(iii) 110 K 
         K -273 = oC  substituting:     110   –   273   =  -163 oC 
 
(iv) -24 K 
         K -273 = oC  substituting:     -24   –   273   =  -297 oC 
 
The standard  temperature is 273K = 0 oC. 
The room  temperature is assumed to be 298K   = 25oC 
 
4. The SI unit of pressure is Pascal( Pa) / Newton per metre squared ( Nm-2) .    
Millimeters ’ of mercury( mmHg ) ,centimeters of mercury( cmHg ) and 
atmospheres  are also commonly used. 
 
The units are not interconvertible but Pascals( Pa) are equal to Newton per metre 
squared( Nm-2). 
The standard  pressure is the atmospheric  pressure.  
Atmospheric pressure is equal  to about: 
 (i)101325 Pa  
 (ii)101325 Nm-2 
 (iii)760 mmHg  
 (iv)76 cmHg 
 (v)one atmosphere. 
 
5. Molecules of gases are always in continuous random motion at high spe ed. This 
motion is affected by the physical conditions of temperature and pressure.  
Physical conditions change the volume occupied by gases in a closed  system.  
The effect of physical conditions of temperature and pressure was investigated  and 
expressed in both Boyles and Charles laws.  
 
6. Boyles law states that 
 “the volume  of a fixed mass of a gas is inversely  proportional to the pressure  
at constant/fixed temperature  ”  
Mathematically: 

     Volume   α             1  (Fixed /constant Temperature)   
                       Pressure 
          V    α            1  (Fixed /constant T)  ie PV = Constant (k) 
                       P 
From Boyles law , an increase  in pressure of a gas cause a decrease  in volume. i.e 
doubling  the pressure cause the volume to be halved . 
Graphically therefore a plot of volume( V) against  pressure ( P) produces a curve . 
 
 
 
 
 
 
           V 
 
 
 
 
  
      P 
Graphically a plot of volume( V) against  inverse/reciprocal of pressure ( 1/p) 
produces a straight line  
 
 
 
 
     V 
 
 
 
 
     1/P 
 
For two gases then  P1 V1 =  P2 V2  
P1  =   Pressure of gas 1  
V1  =  Volume of gas 1 
P2   =   Pressure of gas 2  
V2   =   Volume of gas 2 

 
Practice examples: 
1. A fixed mass of gas at 102300Pa pressure has a volume of 25cm3.Calculate 
its volume if the pressure is doubled. 
Working 
P1 V1 =  P 2 V2      Substituting :102300  x  25  = (102300  x 2) x  V2 
V2 = 102300  x  25     =    12.5cm3  
(102300 x 2) 
 
2. Calculate the pressure which must be applied to a fixed mass of 
100cm3 of Oxygen for its volume to triple at 100000Nm-2. 
 
P1 V1 =  P 2 V2      Substituting :100000  x  100  = P2 x (100 x 3)  
V2 = 1000 00  x  100      =   33333.3333 Nm-2
 
(100 x 3) 
 
3.A 60cm3 weather ballon full of Hydrogen at atmospheric pressure 
of 101325Pa was released into the atmosphere. Will the ballon reach 
stratosphere where the pressure is 90000Pa?  
 
P1 V1 =  P 2 V2      Substituting :101325  x  60  =  90000   x V 2  
V2 = 101325  x  60      =   67.55 cm3  
    90000  
The new volume at 67.55 cm3 exceed  ballon capacity of 60.00 cm3.It 
will burst  before reaching destination. 
 
7.Charles law states that “the volume  of a fixed mass of a gas is directly  
proportional to the absolute temperature at constant/fixed pressure  ”  
Mathematically: 
  Volume   α         Pressure  (Fixed /constant pressure)   
                        
          V    α         T     (Fixed /constant P)  ie    V     = Constant (k) 
                               T 
From Charles law , an increase  in temperature of a gas cause an increase  in 
volume. i.e doubling  the temperature cause the volume to be doubled . 

 Gases expand/increase  by 1/273 by volume on heating.Gases contact/decrease by 
1/273 by volume on cooling at constant/fixed pressure. 
The volume of a gas continue decreasing with decrease in temperature until at  
-273oC /0 K  the volume is zero. i.e. there is no gas.  
This temperature is called absolute zero . It is the lowest  temperature at which a 
gas can exist. 
 
Graphically therefore a plot of volume( V) against  Temperature( T) in:  
(i)oC produces a straight line that is extrapolated  to the absolute zero of -273oC . 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                    V 
 
 
 
 
      -273oC             0oC               T(oC) 
 
 
 
 
 
(ii)Kelvin/K produces a straight line from absolute zero of O Kelvin  
 
 
 
 
     V 
 
 
 
 
          0                         T(Kelvin ) 
 
 

 
For two gases then      V1       =     V2     
       T1             T 2 
T1  =   Temperature in Kelvin  of gas 1  
V1  =  Volume of gas 1 
T2  =   Temperature in Kelvin  of gas 2 
V2   =   Volume of gas 2 
 
Practice examples: 
1. 500cm3 of carbon(IV)oxide at 0oC was transfered into a cylinder at -4oC. If 
the capacity of the cylinder is 450 cm3,explain what happened. 
 
V1       =     V2    substituting       500              =      V2   
T1             T2              (0 +273)              (-4 +273) 
 
     =  500 x (-4 x 273)   =    492.674cm3 
              (0 + 273) 
The capacity of cylinder (500 cm3) is less than new volume(492.674cm3).  
7.326cm3(500-492.674 cm3)of carbon(IV)oxide gas did not fit into the cylinder. 
 
2. A mechanic was filling a deflated tyre with air in his closed garage using a 
hand pump. The capacity of the tyre was 40,000cm3 at room temperature. He 
rolled the tyre into the car outside. The temperature outside was 30oC.Explain 
what happens. 
 
V1       =     V2    substituting       40000              =      V2   
T1             T2              (25 +273)                       (30 +273) 
 
     =  40000 x (30 x 273)   =    40671.1409cm3  
              (25 + 273) 
The capacity of a tyre (40000cm3) is less than new volume(40671.1409cm3 ).  
The tyre thus bursts. 
 
3. A hydrogen gas balloon with 80cm3 was released from a research station at 
room temperature. If the temperature of the highest point it rose is - 30oC , 
explain what happened. 
 
V1       =     V2    substituting         80              =      V2   
T1             T2              (25 +273)                       (-30 +273) 
 
     =   80 x (- 30 x 273)   =    65.2349cm3  

              (25 + 273) 
The capacity of balloon (80cm3) is more  than new volume (65.2349cm3 ).  
The balloon thus remained intact. 
 
8. The continuous random motion of gases differ from gas to the other.The 
movement of molecules (of a gas) from region of high concentration to a region of 
low concentration is called diffusion. 
The rate of diffusion of a gas depends on its density. i.e. The higher the rate of 
diffusion, the less dense the gas . 
The density of a gas depends on its molar mass/relative molecular mass. i.e. The 
higher  the density the higher  the molar mass/relative atomic mass and thus the 
lower  the rate of diffusion. 
Examples 
1.Carbon (IV)oxide(CO 2) has a molar mass of 44g.Nitrogen(N 2)has a molar mass 
of 28g. (N 2)is thus lighter/less dense than Carbon (IV)oxide(CO 2). N 2 diffuses 
faster than CO 2.   
2.Ammonia( NH 3) has a molar mass of 17g.Nitrogen(N 2)has a molar mass of 28g. 
(N2)is thus about twice lighter/less dense than Ammonia( NH 3). Ammonia( NH 3) 
diffuses twice faster than N 2. 
3. Ammonia( NH 3) has a molar mass of 17g.Hydrogen chloride gas has a molar 
mass of 36.5g.Both gases on contact react to form white fumes  of ammonium 
chloride .When a glass/cotton wool dipped in ammonia and another g lass/cotton 
wool dipped in hydrochloric acid are placed at opposite ends of a glass tube, bot h 
gases diffuse towards each other.  A white disk appears near to glass/cotton  wool 
dipped in hydrochloric acid. This is because hydrogen chloride is heavier/den ser 
than Ammonia and thus its rate of diffusion is lower . 
 


 
The rate of diffusion of a gas is in accordance to Grahams law of diffusion . 
Grahams law states that:  
“the rate of diffusion of a gas is inversely proportional to the square root of its 
density, at the same/constant/fixed temperature and pressure ”  
Mathematically 
R   α    1     and  since density is proportional to mass then   R α      1    
  √  p         √  m 
For two gases then: 
R1     =      R 2        where: R 1 and R 2 is the rate of diffusion of 1st and 2nd gas. 
√M 2          √M 1       M1 and M 2 is the molar mass  of 1st and 2nd gas. 
 
Since rate is inverse of time. i.e. the higher the rate the less the time:
