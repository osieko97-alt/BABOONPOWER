 18.0.0 ACIDS, BASES AND SALTS  
(25 LESSONS)  
 
A.ACIDS AND BASES 
At a school laboratory: 
(i)An acid may be defined as a substance that turn litmus red. 
(ii)A base  may be defined as a substance that turn litmus blue. 
Litmus is a lichen found mainly in West Africa. It changes its colour depen ding on 
whether the solution it is in, is basic/alkaline or acidic.It is thus abl e to 
identify/show whether  
 
1. An acid is a substance that dissolves in water to form H+/H3O+ as the only 
positive ion/cation. This is called the Arrhenius definition  of an acid. From this 
definition, an acid dissociate/ionize in water releasing H+ thus: 
 
  HCl(aq)  -&gt;  H+ (aq)  +   Cl- (aq) 
 HNO 3(aq)  -&gt;  H+ (aq)  +   NO 3- (aq) 
 CH 3COO H(aq) -&gt;   H+ (aq)  +   CH 3COO-(aq) 
 H2SO 4(aq)  -&gt;  2 H+ (aq)  +   SO 42-(aq) 
 H2CO 3(aq)  -&gt;  2 H+ (aq)  +   CO 32-(aq) 
 H3PO 4(aq)  -&gt;  3 H+ (aq)  +   PO 43-(aq) 
 
2.A base is a substance which dissolves in water to form OH- as the onl y 
negatively charged ion/anion. 
This is called Arrhenius definition of a base.  
From this definition, a base dissociate/ionize in water releasing OH- thus: 
 
 KOH(aq)   - &gt;  K+(aq)  +  OH-(aq) 
 NaOH(aq)   - &gt;  Na+(aq)  +  OH-(aq) 
 NH 4OH(aq)   - &gt;  NH 4+(aq)  +  OH-(aq) 
 Ca(OH) 2(aq)  - &gt;  Ca2+(aq)  +  2OH-(aq) 
 Mg(OH) 2(aq)  - &gt;  Mg2+(aq)  +  2OH-(aq) 
 
3. An acid is a proton donor.  
A base is a proton acceptor.  
This is called Bronsted-Lowry definition of acids and bases. 

 
 From this definition, an acid donates H+ . 
 H+ has no electrons and neutrons .It contains only a proton.  
Examples 
I. From the equation: 
 
          HCl(aq)  +  H 2O(l)  ===   H 3O+(aq)  +  Cl- (aq) 
 
(a)(i)For the forward reaction from left to right, H 2O  gains a proton to form 
H3O+  and thus H 2O is a proton acceptor  .It is a Bronsted-Lowry base    
 
(ii) For the backward reaction from right to left, H 3O+   donates a proton to    
form H 2O and thus H 3O+  is an ‘opposite ’ proton donor . It is a Bronsted-
Lowry conjugate acid 
 
(b)(i)For the forward reaction from left to right, HCl  donates a proton to 
form Cl-  and thus HCl is a proton donor  . 
It is a Bronsted-Lowry acid    
 
(ii) For the backward reaction from right to left, Cl-   gains a proton to form 
HCl and thus Cl-  is an ‘opposite ’ proton acceptor .  
It is a Bronsted-Lowry conjugate base. 
Every base /acid from Bronsted-Lowry definition thus must have a conjugate 
product/reactant. 
 
II. From the equation: 
 
          HCl(aq)  +  NH 3(aq)  ===   NH 4+(aq)  +  Cl- (aq) 
 
(a)(i)For the forward reaction from left to right, NH 3  gains a proton to form 
NH 4+ and thus NH 3 is a proton acceptor  . 
It is a Bronsted-Lowry base    
 
(ii) For the backward reaction from right to left, NH 4+   donates a proton to    
form NH 3 and thus NH 4+  is an ‘opposite ’ proton donor .  
It is a Bronsted-Lowry conjugate acid 
 
(b)(i)For the forward reaction from left to right, HCl  donates a proton to 
form Cl-  and thus HCl is a proton donor  . 
It is a Bronsted-Lowry acid    
 
(ii) For the backward reaction from right to left, Cl-   gains a proton to form 
HCl and thus Cl-  is an ‘opposite ’ proton acceptor . 
 It is a Bronsted-Lowry conjugate base . 
 

 
 4. Acids and bases show acidic and alkaline properties/characteristics  only in 
water  but not in other solvents e.g. 
 
(a)Hydrogen chloride gas dissolves in water to form hydrochloric acid 
Hydrochloric acid dissociates/ionizes in water to free   H+(aq)/H 3O+(aq) ions. The 
free H 3O+(aq) / H+(aq)  ions are responsible for: 
 
  (i)turning blue litmus paper/solution red. 
 (ii)show pH value 1/2/3/4/5/6 
 (iii)are good electrolytes/conductors of electricity/undergo electrolysis . 
 
 (iv)react with metals to produce /evolve hydrogen gas and a salt. i.e. 
 Ionically:

 It exists in molecular state showing none of the above properties. 
 
(c)Ammonia gas dissolves in water to form aqueous ammonia which 
dissociate/ionize to free NH 4+ (aq) and OH-(aq) ions.

 (d)Ammonia gas dissolves in methylbenzene/benzene /kerosene but does no t 
dissociate into free ions therefore existing as molecules 
 
6. Solvents are either polar  or non-polar .  
A polar solvent is one which dissolves ionic compounds and other pol ar solvents.  
Water is pola r solvent that dissolves ionic and polar substance by surrounding the 
free ions as below: 
    H ð+  H ð+      O ð- 
         
            H ð+  H ð+ 
H ð+  O ð-  H ð+          H ð+ 
                H ð+ 

 
  O ð- H+ O ð-       O ð-   Cl -                O ð- 
             H ð+                  Hð+ 
H ð+  O ð-   H ð+          H+ H ð+ 
 
           H ð+  H ð+      O ð- 
 
 
         Beaker 
          Cl- 
     Cl-      H+   water   
          H+ 
     Cl-      H+   Free ions 
                                                       
            
 Note:Water is polar .It is made up of : 
  Oxygen atom is partially negative and two hydrogen atoms which are partially  
positive.  
They surround the free H+ and Cl- ions. 
A non polar solvent is one which dissolved non-polar substances and co valent 
compounds.  
If a polar ionic compound is dissolved in non-polar solvent ,it does  not 
ionize/dissociate into free ions as below: 
 
                               H-Cl       
             
          H-Cl     
              methyl benzene 
               H-Cl     
         H- Cl    
             
             
         Covalent bond 
 
7. Some acids and bases are strong  while others are weak . 
(a)A strong acid/base is one which is fully/wholly/completely dissociated  / ionized 
into many free H+ /OH- ions i.e.  
I. Strong acids exists more as free H+ ions than molecules. e.g. 
 

 
   HCl(aq)   H+(aq)     +         Cl- (aq)

(b) A weak base/acid is one which is partially /partly dissociated /ionized in water 
into free OH- (aq) and H+(aq) ions.

 CH 3COOH(aq)   H+(aq)     +         CH 3COO- (aq)   
   (molecules)                     (cation)            (anion)

         (molecules)                     (cation)            (anion) 

 
 8. The concentration of an acid/base/alkali is based on the number of mol es of 
acid/bases dissolved in a decimeter(litre)of the solution.  
An acid/base/alkali with more acid/base/alkali in a decimeter(litre)  of solut ion is 
said to be concentrated  while that with less is said to</pre>
