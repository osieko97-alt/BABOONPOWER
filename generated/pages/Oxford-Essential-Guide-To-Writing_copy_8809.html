The New Oxford Guide
to Writing

Introduction
Two broad assumptions underlie this book: (1) that writing
is a rational activity, and (2) that it is a valuable activity.
To say that writing is rational means nothing more than
that it is an exercise of mind requiring the mastery of tech-
niques anyone can learn. Obviously, there are limits: one can-
not learn to write like Shakespeare or Charles Dickens. You
can&#x27;t become a genius by reading a book.
But you don&#x27;t have to be a genius to write clear, effective
English. You just have to understand what writing involves
and to know how to handle words and sentences and para-
graphs. That you can learn. If you do, you can communicate
what you want to communicate in words other people can
understand. This book will help by showing you what good
writers do.
The second assumption is that writing is worth learning. It
is of immediate practical benefit in almost any job or career.
Certainly there are many jobs in which you can get along
without being able to write clearly. If you know how to write,
however, you will get along faster and farther.
There is another, more profound value to writing. We cre-
ate ourselves by words. Before we are businesspeople or law-
yers or engineers or teachers, we are human beings. Our

INTRODUCTION
growth as human beings depends on our capacity to under-
stand and to use language. Writing is a way of growing. No
one would argue that being able to write will make you mor-
ally better. But it will make you more complex and more
interesting—in a word, more human.

CHAPTER
1Subject, Reader,
and Kinds of Writing
Choosing a Subject
Often, of course, you are not free to choose at all. You must
compose a report for a business meeting or write on an as-
signed topic for an English class. The problem then becomes
not what to write about but how to attack it, a question we&#x27;ll
discuss in Chapters 5 and 6.
When you can select a subject for yourself, it ought to in-
terest you, and interest others as well, at least potentially. It
should be within the range of your experience and skill,
though it is best if it stretches you. It ought to be neither so
vast that no one person can encompass it nor so narrow and
trivial that no one cares.
Don&#x27;t be afraid to express your own opinions and feelings.
You are a vital part of the subject. No matter what the topic,
you are really writing about how you understand it, how you
feel about it. Good writing has personality. Readers enjoy
sensing a mind at work, hearing a clear voice, responding to
an unusual sensibility. If you have chosen a topic that is of
general concern, and if genuine feeling and intelligence come
through, you will be interesting. Interest lies not so much in
a topic as in what a writer has made of it.

6 INTRODUCTION
About Readers
You don&#x27;t want to repel readers. This doesn&#x27;t mean you have
to flatter them or avoid saying something they may disagree
with. It does mean you must respect them. Don&#x27;t take their
interest for granted or suppose that it is the readers&#x27; job to
follow you. It&#x27;s your job to guide them, to make their task as
easy as the subject allows.
Ask yourself questions about your readers: What can I ex-
pect them to know and not know? What do they believe and
value? How do I want to affect them by what I say? What
attitudes and claims will meet with their approval? What will
offend them? What objections may they have to my ideas,
and how can I anticipate and counter those objections?
Readers may be annoyed if you overestimate their knowl-
edge. Tossing off unusual words may seem a put-down, a way
of saying, &quot;I know more than you.&quot; On the other hand, la-
boring the obvious also implies a low opinion of readers:
don&#x27;t tell them what a wheel is; they know. It isn&#x27;t easy to
gauge your readers&#x27; level of knowledge or to sense their be-
liefs and values. Sensitivity to readers comes only with ex-
perience, and then imperfectly. Tact and respect, however, go
a long way. Readers have egos too.
Kinds of Writing
The various effects a writer may wish to have on his or her
readers—to inform, to persuade, to entertain—result in dif-
ferent kinds of prose. The most common is prose that in-
forms, which, depending on what it is about, is called
exposition, description, or narration.
Exposition explains. How things work—an internal com-
bustion engine. Ideas—a theory of economics. Facts of every-
day life—how many people get divorced. History—why
Custer attacked at the Little Big Horn. Controversial issues
laden with feelings—abortion, politics, religion. But whatever

SUBJECT, READER, AND KINDS OF WRITING 7
its subject, exposition reveals what a particular mind thinks
or knows or believes. Exposition is constructed logically. It
organizes around cause/effect, true/false, less/more, positive/
negative, general/particular, assertion/denial. Its movement is
signaled by connectives like therefore, however, and so, be-
sides, but, not only, more important, in fact, for example.
Description deals with perceptions—most commonly visual
perceptions. Its central problem is to arrange what we see into
a significant pattern. Unlike the logic of exposition, the pat-
tern is spatial: above/below, before/behind, right/left, and so
on.
The subject of narration is a series of related events—a
story. Its problem is twofold: to arrange the events in a se-
quence of time and to reveal their significance.
Persuasion seeks to alter how readers think or believe. It is
usually about controversial topics and often appeals to reason
in the form of argument, offering evidence or logical proof.
Another form of persuasion is satire, which ridicules folly or
evil, sometimes subtly, sometimes crudely and coarsely. Fi-
nally, persuasion may be in the form of eloquence, appealing
to ideals and noble sentiments.
Writing that is primarily entertaining includes fiction, per-
sonal essays, sketches. Such prose will receive less attention
here. It is certainly important, but it is more remote from
everyday needs than exposition or persuasion.
For Practice
&gt; List ten or twelve topics you might develop into a short essay.
Think of topics that deal not so much with things, places, or how-to-
do projects as with your opinions and beliefs. Pick subjects that
interest you and are within your experience, yet challenging. Be
specific: don&#x27;t simply write &quot;my job&quot; but something like &quot;what I
like most (or hate most) about my job.&quot;
£&gt; Selecting one of the topics on your list, compose a paragraph
about the readers for whom you might develop it. Consider how

8 INTRODUCTION
you wish to affect those readers, what you want them to understand
and feel. Think about their general knowledge, values, attitudes,
biases; whether they are your age or older or younger, come from
a similar or a different background; and how you would like them
to regard you.

CHAPTER
2Strategy and Style
Purpose, the end you&#x27;re aiming at, determines strategy and
style. Strategy involves choice—selecting particular aspects of
a topic to develop, deciding how to organize them, choosing
this word rather than that, constructing various types of sen-
tences, building paragraphs. Style is the result of strategy, the
language that makes the strategy work.
Think of purpose, strategy, and style in terms of increasing
abstractness. Style is immediate and obvious. It exists in the
writing itself; it is the sum of</pre>
