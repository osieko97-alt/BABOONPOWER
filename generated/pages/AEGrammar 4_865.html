Dear Diary,
I was so happy today because I overcame my fear
of speaking in front of the class. My friend Emilywas so helpful because she helped me realize
that standing and speaking in front of others wasnot a big deal. After class was over, Emily had me
stand on a desk. Then, she made me give my
speech over and over until I became comfortablein front of her. She convinced me to speak
confidently with a loud voice and also forced me
to stand up straight while speaking. I am so
grateful for all of her help.
Claire
