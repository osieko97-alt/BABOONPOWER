 1 HEALTH AND NUTRITION  
a. Introduction to health Education  
Health  - a state of complete physical, mental and social well -being and not 
merely the absence of disease and infirmity&quot;  
Health education  is a profession of educating people about health. Areas 
within this profession encompass:  
 environmental health,  
 physical health,  
 social health,  
 emotional health,  
 intellectual health, and  
 spiritual health, as well as  
 sexual and reproductive health education.  
Health education can be defined as the principle by which individuals and 
groups of people learn to behave in a manner conducive to the promotion, 
maintenance, or restoration of health. However, as there are multiple 
definitions of health, there  are also multiple definitions of health education.  
Importance of Health Education  
The importance of health education impacts many areas of wellness within a 
community, including:  
 Chronic disease awareness and prevention  
 Injury and violence prevention  
 Maternal and infant health  
 Mental and behavioral health  
 Nutrition, exercise and obesity prevention  
 Tobacco use and substance abuse  
 It stimulates  people’s  awareness  and skills– Health programs engage skilled 
professionals who meet the community to talk about simple ways to develop and 
sustain health. They learn from practised health workers and pick up skills such 
as first aid. Experts teach them about their weaknesses which ma ke them

 2 susceptible to diseases and infections. Deterioration of health is often 
unpredictable. Hence there is the requirement to search for skills to handle such 
challenges.  
 Health  education  elevates  the student’s  understanding  of health  – It allows 
them to develop their physical, social, and emotional health values. When 
students meet more well -informed people, they learn from them and are ready to 
metamorphose this knowledge. Some of the information they obtain includes 
precautions when engaging in acts such as sexual intercourse. Students can get 
this information from lectures at their institution and educate others when they 
are back in the community.  
 It inspires  the youth  to boost  and keep  up their  health  – Being a part of 
health education programs let s the student see for themselves what it takes to be 
hale and hearty. They are inspired to eat healthy food and take part in the 
exercise. By learning that, they start thinking properly about their health 
principles. Young people have the liveliness to exe rcise and require an incentive 
to be active in improving their health and that of the general public at large.  
 Health  education  improves  the quality  of life – It encompasses good health 
habits that are accepted by health experts to improve the quality of l ife. The 
people come to know about their wrong practices and realize that they need to 
change or improve their habits. They alter their habits and better them so that 
their standards can improve appreciably. For example, they learn to engage in 
protected s exual intercourse to avoid or minimize the spread of STDs.  
 It also reduces  premature  deaths  – The community must study about the 
diverse methods to stop the propagation of diseases and infections. People can 
set up sufficiently to battle epidemics and thwa rt deaths and suffering. The youth 
and children are most susceptible to early deaths when infections and diseases 
hit badly. Vaccinations may be administered at no cost during health education 
programs to prevent premature deaths. It is sensible to attend to such plans when 
the chance presents itself.

b. Health Promotion  
Health promotion  is the process of enabling people to increase control over, 
and to improve, their health. It moves beyond a focus on individual 
behaviour towards a wide range of social and environmental interventions.  
 As a core function of public health, health promotion supports 
governments, communities and individuals to cope with and address 
health challenges.  
 This is accomplished by :  
 building healthy public policies,  
 creating supportive environments, and  
 strengt hening community action and personal skills

physically active can help prevent or delay certain diseases, including 
some cancers, heart disease and di abetes, and also relieve depression

 4 and improve mood. Inactivity often accompanies advancing age, but it 
doesn&#x27;t have to. Check with your local churches or synagogues, senior 
centers, and shopping malls for exercise and walking programs. Like 
exercise, you r eating habits are often not good if you live and eat alone. 
It&#x27;s important for successful aging to eat foods rich in nutrients and 
avoid the empty calories in candy and sweets.

chances of dying from hypertension, type 2 diabetes, coronary heart 
disease, stroke, gallbladder disease, osteoarthritis, sleep apnea, 
respiratory problems, dyslipidemia and endometrial, breast, prostate, 
and colon cancers.  
 Tobacco - Tobacco is the single greatest pr eventable cause of illness 
and premature death  
 Substance Abuse  - Substance abuse usually means drugs and alcohol.  
 HIV/AIDS  -  
 Mental Health  - Dementia is not part of aging. Dementia can be caused 
by disease, reactions to medications, vision and hearing problems, 
infections, nutritional imbalances, diabetes, and renal failure. There are 
many forms of dementia (including Alzheimer&#x27;s Disease) and some can 
be temporary. With accurate diagnosis comes management and help.

Ways of promoting of promoting wellness in individuals  
1. Take Proper Sleep:  
It may seem to be the most common advice, but trust me most of the people 
don’t follow the basic strep towards their overall wellbeing. Our body needs 

Re-inventing CBC for possible solutions  
 5 proper sleep and rest to heal and renew the energy to function properly. 
This healing is essential for physi cal and mental activity throughout the day.  
Sufficient sleep regulates the hormones that are directly related to our mood 
and emotions. Most often when you feel an irritated or emotional imbalance, 
chances are high that your body lacks in taking enough sle ep. An adult body 
needs nearly 6 to 7 hours of sleep per day. So make sure you take enough 
sleep.  
2. Eat a Balanced Diet:  
Sleep alone is not going to give you the required benefits. You need to eat a 
healthy and balanced diet and ensure your body receives enough amount of 
nutrition. The food you consume determines how healthy your inner system 
is. Moreover, it also helps in determining your emotional health and mental 
illnesses such as depression.  
When your body lacks essential nutrients, it leads to seriou s health 
problems. Moreover, you end up facing emotional distress and anxiety. 
Health and wellness experts suggest that you should eat fruits and 
vegetables in sufficient amount. Moreover, eating nuts and lentil also 
strengthens your heart. Try to avoid ca ffeine, sugar and processed food as 
much as possible.  
3. Expose Your Body to Sunlight:  
Vitamin D deficiency leads to several problems such and Seasonal Affective 
Disorder or SAD. When you are exposed to sunlight, it causes the release of 
endorphins also ca lled ‘happiness hormones’ that is responsible for the 
productivity of the brain.  
So, take some time out of your routine and spend some time in sunlight. But 
makes sure you wear sunblock to prevent sunburn.  
 
4. Deal with Stress:  
Although it is difficult to avoid stress nowadays, however, it is definitely 
possible to deal with it. It is very important to learn to deal with stress in a 

Re-inventing CBC for possible solutions  
 6 smart and effective way. For that, try to avoid the situations that cause 
stress. If your stress is unmanageable, note down th e causes of stress as well 
as what actions can you take to improve your reaction, mood, and even 
situation?  
5. Exercise Daily:  
When you remain physically active and exercise daily, your blood flow 
improves in your entire body. With the increased blood flow, the number of 
oxygen increases and you feel more energetic, fresh and mentally active.  
6. Stay Away from Smoking and Alcohol:  
If you keep drinking and smoking, no matter how much you spend on your 
health and how hard you try, your efforts are going t o be wasted.  
Quit smoking and drinking to ensure you lead a healthy life.  
7. Be Social, as Much as You Can:  
Isolation and lack of communication are the two biggest reasons for 
depression, mental and physical illnes</pre>
