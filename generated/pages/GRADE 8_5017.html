SOIL CONSERV ATION:  
INTRODUCTION  
 
Soil provides the nutrients essential for plant growth, animal life, and millions of 
microorganisms. However, if soil becomes unhealthy, unstable, or polluted, the life cycle stops.  
 
Soil conservation  refers to the protection and management of soil resources to prevent 
their degradation and promote sustainable land use practices.  
It is an important field of study and practice aimed at preserving the productivity, 
fertility, and health of soils for fut ure generations.  
Soil is a vital natural resource that plays a crucial role in supporting plant growth, water 
filtration, carbon storage, and providing a habitat for various organisms.  
Threats to soil conservation  
The primary threats to soil conservation  are  
Chemical contamination  
 
The use of pesticides can contaminate the soil, as well as nearby vegetation and water sources, 
with harmful chemicals. In addition to contamination, chemicals used on crops can be toxic to 
important beneficial insects, such as bees, as well as fish and bi rd populations. A Good example 
`is the  growing use of pesticides, herbicides and toxic fertilizers.  
 


Slash and burn  
 
Slash -and-burn farming is the practice of burning and clearing forests to make way for farmland. 
This method kills plant species and displ aces wildlife from their natural habitats. Land cleared 
using slash and burn is only used while it’s productive for farming. Once it loses its fertility, 
another patch of forest is identified for clearing. This unsustainable process repeats endlessly, 
preventing soil from recovering sufficiently to support healthy ecosystems.  
 
Land overuse , overgrazing,  etc. 
 
Overuse of land can limit soil’s ability to play its part in the global climate cycle. For example, 
overcutting forests and woodlands for timber and overgrazing pastures can far outpace the 
natural regrowth of vegetation, subjecting soil to increased exposure to erosion  
 
 
 
 


Importance of Soil Conservation  
Soil conservation is of paramount importance due to the following reasons:  
Preserving Agricultural  Productivity:  Healthy and fertile soil is essential for sustaining 
agricultural productivity. Soil conservation practices help prevent soil erosion, nutrient 
depletion, and degradation, ensuring that the land remains productive for farming. By 
conserving soil, we can maintain high yields, improve food security, and support 
sustainable agriculture.  
Protecting Ecosystems and Biodiversity:  Soil is a crucial component of terrestrial 
ecosystems, supporting diverse plant and animal life. Soil conservation helps preserve 
natural habitats, including forests, grasslands, and wetlands, which are home to a variety 
of species. By protecting soil, we maintain the balance of ecosystems and safeguard 
biodiversity.  
Water Quality and Quantity:  Healthy soil acts as a natural  filter, purifying water as it 
infiltrates through the soil layers. Soil conservation practices reduce runoff and erosion, 
preventing sediment and pollutants from reaching water bodies. By preserving soil, we 
maintain  water quality , prevent contamination, and ensure the availability of clean water 
resources.   
Climate Change Mitigation:  Soils play a sign ificant role in mitigating climate change 
through carbon sequestration. Healthy soils store organic carbon, helping to reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere. By practising soil conservation, such as 
promoting organic matter content and reducing  soil disturbance, we enhance carbon 
storage and contribute to climate change mitigation efforts.  
Mitigating Soil Erosion:  Soil erosion is a natural process, but human activities can 
accelerate it to alarming levels. Erosion leads to the loss of topsoil, w hich contains 
essential nutrients for plant growth. Soil conservation practices, such as contour 
ploughing, terracing, and cover cropping, help control erosion and preserve valuable 
topsoil, ensuri ng long -term land productivity.  
 
 

Methods of Soil Conservation  
There are several effective methods and techniques for soil conservation. Here are some 
commonly used methods:  Grassed waterways  
gr (sometimes also called grass waterways) are wide, shallow channels that are installed 
where water runoff usuall y concentrates in an agricultural field. They are planted with 
permanent vegetation, meaning they might be mowed, but the plants are never plowed or 
killed intentionally  
    
Stone lines are constructed along the contours to slow down the speed of runoff, r educe 
soil erosion, and enhance water infiltration. In addition, the stone barrier blocks and 
settles down the sediments transported from the upper slopes. Stone constructions are 
often used to rehabilitate eroded and abandoned land   
Trash lines are ideal ly 0.5m to 1.0m wide and 0.5m high. Advantages of using trash lines 
They conserve top soil by trapping or reducing the speed of run -off. When they compose 
they turn into manure and boost soil fertility. Trash lines increase soil water infiltration 
since th ey tend to hold the water longer  
  
Bund is an engineering measure of soil conservation, used for creating obstruction across 
the path of surface runoff to reduce the velocity of flowing water. It retains the running 
off water in the watershed and thus to h elps to control soil erosion. Bunds are simply 
embankment like structures, constructed across the land slope  
  
 
 
 

Crop rotation  
Instead of planting the same crop year after year on the same plot of land, crop rotation 
involves planning out growing seasons for different crops. This method of sustainable 
agricultureExternal link:open_in_new requires long -term planning, with crops changed 
every season. In addition to improving soil health and organic matter, crop 
rotationExternal link:open_in_new reduces the n eed for fertilizer and pesticides, lowering 
costs. It also helps prevent excess chemicals from entering water supplies, improving 
water quality.  
Contour Plowing: Plowing along the contour lines of the land helps to slow down water 
runoff, reduce erosion, a nd retain moisture in the soil. This technique involves creating 
furrows or ridges that follow the natural contours of the land.  
 
Terracing:  Terracing is the construction of broad, level platforms on steep slopes.  By 
creating terraces, water runoff is slowed down, allowing it to infiltrate the soil and 
reducing erosion. Terraces also help to retain moisture and provide flat areas for  planting 
crops . 
 


Windbreaks:  Windbreaks are rows of trees or shrubs planted along the edges of fields or 
across wind -exposed areas. They help to reduce wind speed, minimise wind erosion and 
protect the soil. Windbreaks also provide habitat for wildlife and contribute to 
biodiversity.  
 
Strip Cropping:  Strip cropping involves planting different crops in alternating strips or 
bands across a field. This method helps to break up the flow of water and reduce erosion. 
The alternating strips of different crops also help to improve nutrient u ptake and reduce 
pest and disease problems.  
 
Conservation Tillage:  Conservation tillage practices involve reducing or eliminating the 
amount of soil disturbance during planting and cultivation. This includes techniques such 
as no -till, where seeds are pla nted directly into untilled soil, and reduced tillage, where 
minimal soil disturbance occurs. Conservation tillage helps to maintain soil structure, 
reduce erosion, and conserve moisture.  
 
Cover Crops:  Planting cover crops, such as legumes or grasses, dur ing fallow periods or 
between cash crops, helps to protect the soil from erosion, improve soil fertility, and 
increase organic matter content. Cover crops also capture nutrients, prevent weed growth, 
and enhance soil microbial activity.  


 
Mulching:  Applyin g a layer of organic or inorganic material, such as straw, wood chips, 
or plastic, on the soil surface is known as mulching. Mulch helps to conserve soil 
moisture, reduce erosion, regulate soil temperature, suppress weed growth, and improve 
soil structure.  
 
Conservation Buffer Strips:  Buffer strips are areas of vegetation, such as grass or trees, 
established along the edges of fields, water bodies, or sensitive areas. These strips act as 
barriers, filtering runoff, reducing erosion, and preventing the move ment of pollutants 
into water bodies.  
 
Nutrient Management:  Proper nutrient management is essential for soil conservation. It 
involves applying fertilizers based on soil nutrient testing and crop requirements to avoid 
over-application, which can lead to nutrient runoff and pollution. Balanced nutrient 
management helps maintain soil fertility, minimize nutrient losses, and protect water 
quality.  


 
Soil Erosion Control Structures:  Various physical structures, such as contour bunds, 
terraces, check dams and sediment basins, can be constructed to control water flow, trap 
sediment, and reduce erosion in specific areas.   
Wetlands restoration  
This is defined as “removing a threat or preventing the decline of wetland conditions.” 
Wetlands provide a habitat for liv ing creatures of all types. They also act as buffers, 
protecting farmlands from floods.  
Forest cover reestablishment  
In areas where soil has degraded, the reestablishment of forest cover can improve soil and 
restore ecosystem health. This method provides shade for crops and is particularly useful 
for forest farming which cultivates high -value crops, such as those used for medicinal 
purposes.  
Earthworms  
Earthworms  are among the most productive organisms in soil. They digest plant matter, 
releasing essential nutrients into the soil, and their tunnel networks create air channels 
that help water move through the soil.
