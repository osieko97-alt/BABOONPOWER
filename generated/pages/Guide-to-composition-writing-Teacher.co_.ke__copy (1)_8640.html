INTRODUCTION  
Composition writing is an important component in the KCPE 
examination Primary English Paper. In fact it constitutes over 40% 
of what a candidate gets in the English paper.   It goes without saying 
that highlighting on the various skills, principles and challenges in 
writing a composition would be very useful to KCPE examination 
candidates 
What is a Composition?  
The answer to this question varies from person to person depending 
on theme and areas of specialization.  But as for our case, based on 
K.C.P.E examination, a composition is a combination of thoughts and 
ideas put down in a logical manner. A composition can either be 
fictitious or factual depending on the title given (rubric). 
Types of Compositions. 
There is a number of composition types covered under the primary 
school curriculum.  The main ones include;- 
(i)    Narratives 
(ii)   Stories 
(iii)   Letters- friendly and official 
(iv)   Recipes. 
(v)    Reports 
(vi)   Minutes 
(vii)  Dialogues 
(viii)  Filling forms. 
 
NB:-  In all the themes covered in the English syllabus, the last 
exercises introduces a learner into articulating what he or she has 
learnt orally into continuous writing. This dictates the need for proper 
teaching and syllabus coverage to enhance the acquisition of language 
and writing skills

When does a child begin writing a composition?  
The answer to this question is not fixed.  It all depends on the 
interpretation.  But one thing is certain. That composition writing 
begins as soon as child begins to think critically and recall what he 
or she sees, learns, hears and feels. This should tell us that a child 
begins ‘writing’ composition even before joining a formal system of 
education.  In formal education, a pupil is introduced to letters then 
to words and subsequently sentences.  It is the combination of 
sentences that bring about a paragraph and many paragraphs bring 
out a story.  Of course the paragraphs should be centered on a given 
goal lesson or subject. They should also make sense to both the writer 
and the reader otherwise the whole process could be futile. The 
writers thoughts should come out strongly, in fact show me a piece 
of good writing and I shall tell you the mind of the writer 
Writing a Composition.  
 
Writing a composition depends on a number of factors some of which 
are answers to the following questions 
1.      Is it a guided composition?     
This is mainly done in class 3,4 and 5 
2.      Is it a topical composition?  
This type of composition is some what restrictive in that the pupil is 
expected to develop the story from a certain angle or point of view - 
Much is expected since the facts are known 
Examples of topical compositions, given in form of a composition 
title are; 
         The August Holiday 
         A wedding Ceremony 
         A tree plating day 
         Soil Erosion 
.       
3.      Is it a started composition or an ended composition?  
This has been the mode of K.C.P.E testing of composition since its 
inception.  I don’t wish to suggest that a change is impossible.  All

what is stipulated in the curriculum is examinable and therefore 
candidates should practice on all the areas. 
NB:- In most of the K.C.P.E composition tasks, the topic is often 
open ended.  This means that a learner has a wide scope of 
what to write about.  Below are the beginning of compositions 
for various years in K.C.P.E.  
 
These and many other questions dictated how a composition should 
be written.  However, one major factor in writing a composition is 
one’s preparedness.  Think critically on what you have to write about 
and list down the main points. 
This may sound unusual but unless a person on a journey knows 
where he is, where he wants to go and how far it is from his initial 
position, the journey may not take place.  The writer can ease the 
writing of a composition if an attempt is made to answer questions 
such as what?, where?,when? How? and so?  as relates to the 
composition to be written. For instance if one was to write a 
composition on the topic A Wedding Ceremony , the following 
questions can go a long way in making a pupil focus on the topic,  
1.       Who is wedding?  
2.       Where is the wedding taking place?  
3.       When is the wedding taking place?  
4.       How are the preparations before the wedding?  
5.       What is your take or involvement in the wedding?  
6.       What were the emerging issues during the wedding?  
7.      So how did it end and what was the day like?  
A good composition should therefore have the following notable 
characteristics: 
(i)                  An interesting introduction  – one that captivates the 
reader and acts as a gateway to the writers thoughts. It should be 
short, clear and interesting. 
(ii)               A body  – that brings together the writers thoughts and ideas 
logically and must be explicit/ elaborate. 
(iii)             A conclusion  - This captures the lesson experienced in the 
whole plot.  It brings out the writers feeling about the whole story or

sums up the story. At times it leaves the reader to guess the outcome 
of an episode. 
 Basing on the title – A wedding ceremony  – the introduction should 
be such that it touches on the people wedding, the place or venue 
and the preparation in place. 
The body should concentrate much on the ceremony itself- from the 
service, the officiating, and the signing of the certificate, the cutting 
of the cake, the eating process and the giving of gifts. 
The conclusion should highlight the general feeling of the ceremony 
and the departure from the venue.  The attitude of the writer is felt 
here. Where need be, a proverb is best placed to conclude a story. 
 
 
SKILLS IN COMPOSITION WRITING.  
 Below are a number of skills necessary in writing a good 
composition. 
(i)                 Legibility  
First and foremost, a piece of writing must be appealing to both the 
writer and the reader.  The teacher for that matter looks at the level 
of legibility as a merit.  An illegible (one that cannot be read) 
composition is bound to score less compared to the former.  Let your 
lettering be correct. Some pupils do not write certain letters correctly 
which bring about some confusion. For example a pupil can writ e 
letter a look like letter Q, letter  r   that looks like v. Let your letters 
be very clear. The rubbing of any letter or word should be such that 
the marks do not overlap causing illegibility of the intended word. 
Avoid crossing a word and writing another one above it. 
The spacing of words should be uniform and not too close neither too 
far apart.  The letters if possible should follow a particular pattern 
preferably erect and should be large enough. 
 
 
  
(ii)                Fluency

A script should be such that ideas tend to flow in a logical manner.  
Many candidates find themselves mixing up ideas. For example, what 
should have been the introduction comes last and what should have 
been the conclusion comes first.  In the case of events, we would 
expect a certain sequence of proceedings that do not seem to overlap.  
Fluency is also affected by ideas that do not seem to fully develop or 
come in quick successions.  Such a composition is termed as being 
“jerky”.  
For example, in reference to a composition on A wedding ceremony, 
it is not in order to have the arrival of bridal team coming first, then 
followed by writing about the venue and then jumping onto the party 
and then the signing of the certificate.  In such a case the flow is 
hampered.  Another element that hampers flow in composition 
writing is the mixing of tenses and wrong structures that tend to 
confuse the reader.  Punctuation is yet another area that affects the 
fluency of a composition as we shall see later under challenges in 
composition writing. 
(iii)             Accuracy  
This includes all the other elements of language in terms of word 
agreement, correct use of words, phrases, proverbs, paragraphing, 
and punctuation and so on.  What hinder accuracy are the numerous 
errors displayed in the scripts.  These will be highlighted later. 
(iv)              Creativity  
This is a skill that has to be developed through interest and being 
dynamics while interacting with the course content as well as the 
immediate environment.  It involves coming up with a unique 
composition that use correct but unfamiliar words, expressions and 
creates suspense - You keep yearning for more when the story ends.  
Involvement of all the senses in a composition makes it interesting, 
varied and the reader relates well with it.  Creating scenes within a 
scene but still keeping the flow can be one way of expressing 
creativity.- for example on a composition on sports,  a writer could 
create a scene within  the main scene about sports where perhaps  a 
player is about to score but a mad man dashes into the field as if 
from hell and picks the ball after which he runs with it into the maize 
plantation, or The guest of honour in a harambee meeting thanks the

audience and volunteers to pray for the hefty collection only to find 
the money gone after. 
 
(v)                Originality  
Our learning environment has become affected by an attitude of 
laxity. Most learners have a tendency of copying work or cramming 
or memorizing passages, stories or paragraphs from the many sample 
composition in textbooks in order to impress the teachers.  This 
hinders originality of a composition.  
This is a practice that should be avoided at all cost. Candidates 
should realize that those who mark KCPE composition are teachers 
who have come across all those compositions in revision books. T</pre>
