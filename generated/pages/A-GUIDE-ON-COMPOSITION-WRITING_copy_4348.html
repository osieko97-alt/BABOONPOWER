<pre>A ​  ​ GUIDE ​  ​ ON ​  ​ COMPOSITION ​  ​ WRITING  
 INTRODUCTION  
 Composition writing is an important component in the KCPE examination Primary English             
 Paper. In fact it constitutes over 40% of what a candidate gets in the English paper. It goes                   
 without saying that highlighting on the various skills, principles and challenges in writing a               
 composition ​  ​ would ​  ​ be ​  ​ very ​  ​ useful ​  ​ to ​  ​ KCPE ​  ​ examination ​  ​ candidates  
 What ​  ​ is ​  ​ a ​  ​ Composition?  
 The answer to this question varies from person to person depending on theme and areas of                 
 specialization. But as for our case, based on K.C.P.E examination, a composition is a               
 combination of thoughts and ideas put down in a logical manner. A composition can either be                 
 fictitious ​  ​ or ​  ​ factual ​  ​ depending ​  ​ on ​  ​ the ​  ​ title ​  ​ given ​  ​ (rubric).  
 Types ​  ​ of ​  ​ Compositions.  
 There are a number of composition types covered under the primary school curriculum. The               
 main ​  ​ ones ​  ​ include;-  
 (i) ​     ​ Narratives  
 (ii) ​    ​ Stories  
 (iii) ​    ​ Letters- ​  ​ friendly ​  ​ and ​  ​ official  
 (iv) ​   ​  ​​ Recipes.  
 (v) ​    ​  ​​ Reports  
 (vi) ​   ​  ​​ Minutes  
 (vii) ​   ​ Dialogues  
 (viii) ​  ​  ​​ Filling ​  ​ forms.  
 NB:- ​ In all the themes covered in the English syllabus, the last exercises introduces a learner into                  
 articulating what he or she has learnt orally into continuous writing. This dictates the need for                 
 proper ​  ​ teaching ​  ​ and ​  ​ syllabus ​  ​ coverage ​  ​ to ​  ​ enhance ​  ​ the ​  ​ acquisition ​  ​ of ​  ​ language ​  ​ and ​  ​ writing ​  ​ skills  
  
  
 When ​  ​ does ​  ​ a ​  ​ child ​  ​ begin ​  ​ writing ​  ​ a ​  ​ composition?  
 The answer to this question is not fixed. It all depends on the interpretation. But one thing is                   
 certain. That composition writing begins as soon as child begins to think critically and recall                
 what he or she sees, learns, hears and feels. This should tell us that a child begins ‘writing’                   
 composition even before joining a formal system of education. In formal education, a pupil is                
 introduced to letters then to words and subsequently sentences. It is the combination of               
 sentences that bring about a paragraph and many paragraphs bring out a story. Of course the                 
 paragraphs should be centered on a given goal lesson or subject. They should also make sense                 
 to both the writer and the reader otherwise the whole process could be futile. The writers                 

thoughts should come out strongly, in fact show me a piece of good writing and I shall tell you                    
 the ​  ​ mind ​  ​ of ​  ​ the ​  ​ writer  
 Writing ​  ​ a ​  ​ Composition.  
  
 Writing a composition depends on a number of factors some of which are answers to the                 
 following ​  ​ questions  
 1. ​      ​  ​​ Is ​  ​ it ​  ​ a ​  ​ guided ​  ​ composition?   
 This ​  ​ is ​  ​ mainly ​  ​ done ​  ​ in ​  ​ class ​  ​ 3,4 ​  ​ and ​  ​ 5  
 2. ​      ​  ​​ Is ​  ​ it ​  ​ a ​  ​ topical ​  ​ composition?   
 This type of composition is some what restrictive in that the pupil is expected to develop the                  
 story ​  ​ from ​  ​ a ​  ​ certain ​  ​ angle ​  ​ or ​  ​ point ​  ​ of ​  ​ view ​  ​ - ​  ​ Much ​  ​ is ​  ​ expected ​  ​ since ​  ​ the ​  ​ facts ​  ​ are ​  ​ known  
 Examples ​  ​ of ​  ​ topical ​  ​ compositions, ​  ​ given ​  ​ in ​  ​ form ​  ​ of ​  ​ a ​  ​ composition ​  ​ title ​  ​ are;  
         ​  ​​ The ​  ​ August ​  ​ Holiday  
         ​  ​​ A ​  ​ wedding ​  ​ Ceremony  
         ​  ​​ A ​  ​ tree ​  ​ plating ​  ​ day  
         ​  ​​ Soil ​  ​ Erosion  
 .  
 3. ​      ​  ​​ Is ​  ​ it ​  ​ a ​  ​ started ​  ​ composition ​  ​ or ​  ​ an ​  ​ ended ​  ​ composition?  
 This has been the mode of K.C.P.E testing of composition since its inception. I don’t wish to                  
 suggest that a change is impossible. All what is stipulated in the curriculum is examinable and                 
 therefore ​  ​ candidates ​  ​ should ​  ​ practice ​  ​ on ​  ​ all ​  ​ the ​  ​ areas.  
 NB:- In most of the K.C.P.E composition tasks, the topic is often open ended. This means that                  
 a learner has a wide scope of what to write about. Below are the beginning of compositions                  
 for ​  ​ various ​  ​ years ​  ​ in ​  ​ K.C.P.E.  
  
 These and many other questions dictated how a composition should be written. However, one               
 major factor in writing a composition is one’s preparedness. Think critically on what you have                
 to ​  ​ write ​  ​ about ​  ​ and ​  ​ list ​  ​ down ​  ​ the ​  ​ main ​  ​ points.  
 This may sound unusual but unless a person on a journey knows where he is, where he wants                   
 to go and how far it is from his initial position, the journey may not take place. The writer can                     
 ease the writing of a composition if an attempt is made to answer questions such as what?,                  
 where?,when? How? and so? as relates to the composition to be written. For instance if one                 
 was to write a composition on the topic ​ A Wedding Ceremony ​ , the following questions can go a                  
 long ​  ​ way ​  ​ in ​  ​ making ​  ​ a ​  ​ pupil ​  ​ focus ​  ​ on ​  ​ the ​  ​ topic,  
 1. ​      ​  ​​ ​  ​ Who ​  ​ is ​  ​ wedding?  
 2. ​      ​  ​​ ​  ​ Where ​  ​ is ​  ​ the ​  ​ wedding ​  ​ taking ​  ​ place?  
 3. ​      ​  ​​ ​  ​ When ​  ​ is ​  ​ the ​  ​ wedding ​  ​ taking ​  ​ place?  
 4. ​      ​  ​​ ​  ​ How ​  ​ are ​  ​ the ​  ​ preparations ​  ​ before ​  ​ the ​  ​ wedding?  
 5. ​      ​  ​​ ​  ​ What ​  ​ is ​  ​ your ​  ​ take ​  ​ or ​  ​ involvement ​  ​ in ​  ​ the ​  ​ wedding?  

6. ​      ​  ​​ ​  ​ What ​  ​ were ​  ​ the ​  ​ emerging ​  ​ issues ​  ​ during ​  ​ the ​  ​ wedding?  
 7. ​      ​  ​​ So ​  ​ how ​  ​ did ​  ​ it ​  ​ end ​  ​ and ​  ​ what ​  ​ was ​  ​ the ​  ​ day ​  ​ like?  
 A ​  ​ good ​  ​ composition ​  ​ should ​  ​ therefore ​  ​ have ​  ​ the ​  ​ following ​  ​ notable ​  ​ characteristics:  
 (i) ​                 An interesting introduction – one that captivates the reader and acts as a gateway to the                   
 writers ​  ​ thoughts. ​  ​ It ​  ​ should ​  ​ be ​  ​ short, ​  ​ clear ​  ​ and ​  ​ interesting.  
 (ii) ​               ​ A body – that brings together the writers thoughts and ideas logically and must be explicit/                  
 elaborate.  
 (iii) ​             ​ A conclusion - This captures the lesson experienced in the whole plot. It brings out the                  
 writers feeling about the whole story or sums up the story. At times it leaves the reader to                   
 guess ​  ​ the ​  ​ outcome ​  ​ of ​  ​ an ​  ​ episode.  
 Basing on the title ​ – A wedding ceremony – the introduction should be such that it touches on                    
 the ​  ​ people ​  ​ wedding, ​  ​ the ​  ​ place ​  ​ or ​  ​ venue ​  ​ and ​  ​ the ​  ​ preparation ​  ​ in ​  ​ place.  
 The body should concentrate much on the ceremony itself- from the service, the officiating,               
 and the signing of the certificate, the cutting of the cake, the eating process and the giving of                   
 gifts.  
 The conclusion should highlight the general feeling of the ceremony and the departure from the                
 venue. The attitude of the writer is felt here. Where need be, a proverb is best placed to                   
 conclude ​  ​ a ​  ​ story.  
  
  
 SKILLS ​  ​ IN ​  ​ COMPOSITION ​  ​ WRITING.  
 ​  ​​ Below ​  ​ are ​  ​ a ​  ​ number ​  ​ of ​  ​ skills ​  ​ necessary ​  ​ in ​  ​ writing ​  ​ a ​  ​ good ​  ​ composition.  
 (i) ​                 ​  ​​ Legibility   
 First and foremost, a piece of writing must be appealing to both the writer and the reader. The                   
 teacher for that matter looks at the level of legibility as a merit. An illegible (one that cannot be                    
 read) composition is bound to score less compared to the former. Let your lettering be correct.                 
 Some pupils do not write certain letters correctly which bring about some confusion. For               
 example a pupil can write letter ​ a look like letter ​ Q, letter r that looks like ​ v. ​ Let your letters be                      
 very clear. The rubbing of any letter or word should be such that the marks do not overlap                   
 causing illegibility of the intended word. Avoid crossing a word and writing another one above                
 it.  
 The spacing of words should be uniform and not too close neither too far apart. The letters if                   
 possible ​  ​ should ​  ​ follow ​  ​ a ​  ​ particular ​  ​ pattern ​  ​ preferably ​  ​ erect ​  ​ and ​  ​ should ​  ​ be ​  ​ large ​  ​ enough.  
  
 (ii) ​               ​  ​​ ​  ​ Fluency   
 A script should be such that ideas tend to flow in a logical manner. Many candidates find                  
 themselves mixing up ideas. For example, what should have been the introduction comes last               
 and what should have been the conclusion comes first. In the case of events, we would expect                  

a certain sequence of proceedings that do not seem to overlap. Fluency is also affected by                 
 ideas that do not seem to fully develop or come in quick successions. Such a composition is                  
 termed ​  ​ as ​  ​ being ​  ​ “jerky”.   
 For example, in reference to a composition on ​ A wedding ceremony ​ , it is not in order to have                   
 the arrival of bridal team coming first, then followed by writing about the venue and then          </pre>
