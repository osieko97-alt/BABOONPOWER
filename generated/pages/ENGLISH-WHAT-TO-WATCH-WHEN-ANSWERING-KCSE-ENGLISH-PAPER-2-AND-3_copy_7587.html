<pre>What to watch out for when answering 
questions in KCSE English Paper Two and 
Three  
By Lucy Kamau  
The set texts studied in secondary school are tested in KCSE English Paper Two and Paper 
Three. Paper Two is usually set as an excerpt taken from any part of one of the compulsory texts 
and then questions are set from it.  
One of the common and tricky questions on the excerpt is placing the excerpt in its immediate 
context, which requires the student to place the excerpt exactly where it was taken from in the 
text. This means that the student needs to have mastered the plot and have the fine details of the 
events, including the quotes and exact words of the characters.  
 
A student who has mastered the plot is able to talk about the events that happen just before and 
immediately after the excerpt, which is what is expected of such a question. The events before 
are supposed to be presented in prose (not in point form) using simple present tense.  


The other questions on the excerpt are mainly on the themes, styles and  characters. The 
characters are described using adjectives while themes and styles are stated using nouns. All the 
answers given on the three areas should be well illustrated using evidence from the excerpt.  
Students who identify themes, styles or characte r traits without illustrations may not score any 
marks because the identification may be considered as guess work. There may also be questions 
on comprehension, interpretation and grammar. Other questions may require the student to relate 
the events in the  excerpt to others in the text, which again emphasises the importance of mastery 
of the text.  
Paper Three is about essay writing, where students are expected to write three essays, two of 
which are based on the set texts. The essay questions test the stude nt’s mastery of the text as well 
as his analytical and critical ability, which will enable him to advance plausible arguments with 
relevant illustrations.  
Before embarking on the writing, you should interpret and establish the demands of the question, 
whic h can be done by identifying the major words and their meaning, which can then be related 
to the text. It is also important to plan your essay by identifying your points, the illustrations to 
support them and the order in which you will present them in you r essay. You can organise your 
points in their order of strength.  
A good essay has an introduction, a body and a conclusion. There are various ways of writing an 
introduction; it can be a general comment on the society based on the statement in the questio n, a 
contextualised comment, which focuses on the text, or a combination of both, starting with the 
general then the contextualised.  
Another way is to write an outline of the various points that you will discuss in the body. It is 
important to note that de finition is not considered an introduction because defining the terms 
alone does not prove that you have understood and interpreted the question. The introduction 
should be brief and on its own paragraph.     
The body is divided into well structured paragra phs with each paragraph discussing one point. 
Each paragraph should have a topic sentence which gives a general idea about what the 
paragraph will talk about. This should be followed by supporting sentences, which give more 
information on the topic sentenc e. The supporting evidence should be taken from the text and 
should be relevant to the question. As you present your evidence, always go back to the question 
and ensure that your illustrations are addressing and meeting the demands of the question. End 
your paragraphs with a clincher which concludes the paragraph by showing the relevance of the 
paragraph to the question.  
Your essay should have a conclusion, which can be a recap of the points or a statement that 
shows the validity of what is stated in the qu estion. Like the introduction, the conclusion should 
be as brief as possible and on its own paragraph. Ensure that you do not have sub -headings in 
your essay and it does not exceed 4 50 words to avoid unnecessary penalties.  
  

The following is a sample essay  question from The Caucasian Chalk Circle:  
‘The play, The Caucasian Chalk Circle is satirical.’ Write an essay to show the validity of 
this statement, drawing illustrations from Bertolt Brecht’s The Caucasian Chalk Circle:  
“In society, some institutions an d individuals have weaknesses which make them do things that 
are contrary to the expectation of those who rely on them. In The Caucasian Chalk Circle, 
institutions such as judiciary, religion, government and armed force are humorously criticised to 
bring o ut their weaknesses such as corruption, hypocrisy and misuse of power among others. 
Individual weaknesses are also highlighted in the same way in characters like Natella, Aniko, 
Lavrenti and the monk.  
The government in Grusinia is portrayed as an irrespons ible one which has neglected its subjects. 
As governor Abashwili attends the service on Easter Sunday, he is approached by beggars and 
petitioners at his doorstep, who are pleading with him but he ignores them and his soldiers lash at 
them with whips. The petitioners complain about high taxes, employees taking bribes, their sons 
being drafted to the army, family members being falsely accused and being maimed in war. The 
governor, who is representative of the government, is ridiculed when he doesn’t address his 
subjects but instead prefers to attend the service. The princes also take advantage of war to 
enrich themselves at the expense of their country. They fight for contracts instead of fighting for 
their country and their greed is humorously highlighted wh en they receive funds for food and 
horses, which they embezzle, failing to supply food and bringing sick horses. Irresponsibility on 
the part of the government and greed on the part of the princes results in a coup, which leaves 
many dead and many more suf fering. It is through satirising the leaders that Brecht exposes the 
weaknesses in the government.  
The judicial system is also ridiculed from the appointment of the judge to the way he handles 
cases and the rulings that he makes. There is no due process th at is followed in the appointment 
of the judge and his qualifications are a non -entity. When he sits on the judge’s chair, he 
exercises corruption by demanding bribes openly and, instead of using the statute book when 
delivering his verdicts, he sits on it . At one point, he sits on the floor and tells granny, one of the 
accused, to sit on the judge’s chair and make the ruling. By satirising the judge, vices such as 
corruption, nepotism and opportunism that are in the judiciary are brought out.             
Brecht also criticises religion, which is seen as a channel that all individuals use to exercise their 
hypocritical tendencies. Aniko, Grusha’s sister -in-law, is said to be so sensitive and religious that 
she cannot stand people talking of an illegitimate ch ild and she pressurises her husband until he 
finds a husband for his sister. It is ironically ridiculous for her to talk of being sensitive and 
religious when she is exactly the opposite. George Aahswili, the governor, also portrays religious 
hypocrisy whe n he ignores beggars and petitioners who are evidently in dire need of help yet he 
is going to church. The monk who should be an epitome of morality, goes to the tavern and 
presides over the funeral -cum-wedding service while drunk. By ridiculing these char acters, their 
hypocritical nature is highlighted and religion does not seem to teach people virtues that enhance 
compassion and honesty.  

Marriage and family is satirised and some of the people in marriage are there for their own 
conveniences. Natella Abash wili is clearly in the marriage for material gains and has no feelings 
for her husband, who is beheaded. Lavrenti lives in the shadow of his wife and does everything 
to please her even at the expense of his sister. The two are ridiculed to bring out their 
hypocritical and selfish nature at the same time highlighting hypocrisy in families.  
In conclusion, it is evident that Brecht has effectively brought out individual and institutions’ 
weaknesses through satire.”  
  
The above sample is just a guide that is no t exhaustive. There are other characters like the fat 
prince, the old man with the milk and the mother -in law that are also satirised. Students are 
encouraged to be on the lookout for more questions and attempt them. The best essays will be 
published.
