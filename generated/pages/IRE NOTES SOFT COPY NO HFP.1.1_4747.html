CHAPTER 1  
 
QURAN  
Read [Q: 36:2]; [Q: 85:21];[Q: 17:9]  
Meaning of the Quran  
The Quran is a religious book used by Muslims all over the world as a book of guidance. Most of  the 
world religions have their specific books which they use for reference. Do you know any religious 
books used by members other faiths? Can you mention any of them? Just as every religion has its 
own religious book, Muslims have the Quran as their main source of reference and they have a duty 
to learn, understand and constantly refer to it. As a Muslim, have you read the Quran? Muslims 
believe that the Holy Quran is the last book to be revealed by Allah. It is because of its important 
position in the Isl amic faith that throughout our course we shall be using the Quran as our immediate 
source of reference.  
 
Can you remember the meaning of the word Quran from your Islamic Religious Education in 
Primary school?  
This word comes from an Arabic root qara&#x27;a which means &quot;to read or to recite.” Quran in Arabic 
therefore literally means recitation or something that is continuously recited. It is equivalent in 
meaning      to      qira&#x27;ah,      as      both      come      from      the       same       verb       ‘qara&#x27;a.’  
This name is specifically mentioned in the text of the Quran as a reference to itself in several places. 
From the verses you have read, you will learn that the Quran has been referred as a book of 
guidance, a book full of wisdom and a Glorious.  Read the following  verses:  
In Islam the word Quran is defined as the divine speech of Allah Subhanahu Wa Taala (S.W.T), sent 
down upon the last Prophet Muhammad Peace be Upon Him (P.B.U.H), through the Angel Jibril 
Aleihi Swalatu wa Salaam(A.S) to human k ind. Since its revelation the Quran has remained the  
same without being  distorted.

 Other Names of the Quran  
Do you know that the  Quran is referred to with other different names? Mention some of these  
names. For the names you have mentioned, it can be seen that some of the names of the Quran have 
been referred to in the Quran itself while others are derived from the functions of th e Quran. Among 
these names  are: 
 Furqaan  (criterion)  “Blessed is He Who sent down the Criterion to His servant, that it 
may be an admonition to  all creatures.”  [Q: 25: 1]  
 Nadhir (warner) “Verily this Quran Doth guide to that which is most right (or stable), and 
giveth the Glad tidings to the believers who work deeds of righteousness, that they have a 
magnificent reward.” [Q: 17:9]  
 Rahma (mercy) “A guide and a Mercy to the doers of good” [Q: 31:3]  
 Tanzil (revelation) “Verily this is a Revelation from the Lord of the Worlds.” [Q: 26:  192] 
 Dhikr (reminder) “We have without doubt, send down the message; And We will assuredly 
guard it (from corruption )[Q: 15:  9] 
 Kitab (The book) “We have revealed f or you (O men) a Book in which is a message for 
you: will you not then understand.” [Q : 21:10]  
 Hudan (Guidance) “We gave Moses the book, and made it a Guide to the children of  Israel,  
(commanding): “Take not other than Me as disposer of (your) affair.” [Q:17: 2:5 ] 
All these names reflect one of the various aspects of the revealed words of Allah. Other 
names include Nur (Light), Majid (Glorious), and Mubarak (Blessed) Bashir (Announcer), 
among others. Can you mention the other names of the Holy Quran that hav e not been listed 
above?  
 
 
 
a) Ulumul  Quran  
The term Ulum means ‘a science.’ Itrefers to the detailed scientific study of a subject. If you look at 
the various subjects you are offered in Form one, you will notice that each of them has a different 
approach of studying it.These approaches are what we refer to as Ulum (theScience).The Quran, 
being a wide subject area of study also has its unique features that must be studied in a particular 
way. Therefore, Ulumul Quran is a scientific study that includes a variet y of fields related to Al – 
Quran such as it’s:  
 Revelation.  
 Collection and  compilation.  
 Order and arrangement of suras.

 Translation of the Quran (tafsir).  
 Reasons for the translation of the suras ( Asbaabu Nnuzul)  
 Characteristics of  language  
 Style of writing and  theme  
 Recitation (Tajweed) among  other  
We are going to look at one of the above areas in our next discussion.  
 
Need for the revelation of the Quran.  
 
In life everything has a reason and a purpose for its being, just as we have a purpose for coming to 
school. Why do you think the Quran was revealed to humankind? Revelation of the Quran came at a 
time when there was ignorance and the socity was full of social vices, a period referred to as 
Jahiliya. Someof the reasons for revelation  of the Quran are as  follows:  
• The earlier scriptures were tampered and interfered with by man thus losing their 
authenticity. Hence the revelation of the Quran was to correct the wrong  message.  
• The Quran was given to Prophet Muhammad, the seal of the prophet with a  universal  
message unlike the other books which were sent to particular generations at specific time.  
For example The Torah (Taurat) was sent to the Children of Israel through Prophet Musa 
(A.S) while Zabur was sent to the followers of Proph et Daud.  
Read the following two verses from the Holy Quran:  
 
 
Almighty Allah (S.W.T) Says :“To the Thamud people (We sent) Salih, one of their own 
brethren: He said: ‘O my people! Worship Allah; ye have no other god but Him.Now has 
come unto you a clear sig nfrom your Lord! This she camel of Allah is a sign unto you...” 
[Q: 7:73]  
 
Almighty Allah (S.W.T) Says: “To the Ad people, (We send) Hud, one of their own 
brethren: He said: ‘O my people! Worship Allah! You have No other god but Him. Will 
you not fear (Alla h)?” [Q: 7:65]  
 
• To fulfill Allah’s promise as well as prophesies of the other earlier revealed scriptures on the 
coming of the Quran and that of prophet Muhammad  (P.B.U.H ). 
Almighty  Allah  (S.W.T)Says: “And  remember,  Jesus,  the son of Mary,  said:  ‘O children  of 
Israel!  I am the messenger  of Allah  (sent)  to you confirming  the law (which  came)  before  

| P a g e 4  
 me and giving Glad Tidings of a messenger to come after mewhose name shall be 
Ahmad.But when he came to them with clear signs, they said, ‘This is  evident sorcery.” [Q: 
61:6]  
• To narrate and summarizestories and events of the earlier generation in order to offer 
teachings, lessons, warnings and guidance to shape  community.  
Almighty Allah (S.W.T)Says :“There is in, their stories,instructions for men endued with  
understanding.It is not a tale invented,but a confirmation of what went before it -A detailed 
exposition of all things,and a guide and a mercy to any such as believe.” [Q: 12: 111]  
• Believe in One True God: The most important topic mentioned thro ughout the Quran is the 
belief in the One, True God. God informs us that He has no partner, no son, no equal, and 
that none has the right to be worshipped except Him alone. Nothing is comparable to God 
and none of His creation resembles Him. The Qur’an als o rejects the notion of attributing 
human qualities and limitations to Allah  (SWT).  
Almighty Allah (S.W.T) says, “And your god is One God. There is no god but He, the Most 
Gracious, the Mos t Merciful.” [Q 2:163]  
• Rejection All False Gods: Since Allah alone is the only One worthy of worship, false gods 
must be rejected. The Quranalso rejects the notion of attributing divine qualities to anyone or 
anything other than  Allah.  
Almighty Allah (S.W.T) Says: “And worship Allah and associate none  with Him…”  [Q: 
4:36]  
• To remind us of the Day of Judgment:This Holy Quranreminds us that everyone will taste 
death and will be held accountable for all their actions and  sayings:  
Almighty Allah (S.W.T) says: “We shall set up scales of justice for the Day of Judgment, so 
that not a soul will be dealt with unjustly in the least…” [Q: 21:47]  
• Fulfilling the Intended Way of Life : The purpose of life is to worship Allah alone, and live 
one’s life according to the way of life prescribed by Allah. In Islam, worship is a 
comprehensive t erm that includes all actions and sayings (whether private or public) that 
Allah loves and is pleased with. Therefore, by doing what Allah commands, a Muslim is 
worshipping God and fulfilling his purpose in  life. 
Almighty Allah (S.W.T) says, “I have only c reated Jinns and men, that they may serve  
Me.” [Q: 51:56]

 REVELATION  
Revelation is the divine communication of Allah (S.W.T) to his creatures. In this communication, 
Allah (S.W.T) either uses the Arch Angel Jibril or any by other methods which shall be studies in 
Form Two. An example of this communication is when Allah (S.W.T) revealed to the Holy Prophet 
(P.B.U.H) the first five verses of Sura al -Alaqa through Angel Jibril. Refer to [Q: 96:1 -5] 
The above paragraph shows us thatthe Almight y Allah (S.W.T) communicates to his Prophets in the 
form of revelations. Allah (S.W.T) says in the Holy Quran that;  
“It is not fitting for a man that Allah should speak to him except by inspiration, or from behind a 
veil, or by sending of a messenger to re veal, with Allah’s permission, what Allah will; for He is 
most High, Most Wise.” [Q: 42:51] From the verse we have readwe see the Arch Angel Jibril acting 
as an intermediary between Allah (S.W.T) andthe prophets as the bearer of the revelation.Angel 
Jibril undertook the following duties in the revelation of the  Qur’an:  
a) The role of Angel  Jibril  
1. He lowered the Quran from Lauhil Mahfudh (well preserved tablet), the seventh heaven to 
Baitul– Izza; the lowest heaven.  
2. He lowered the Quran from Baitul -Izza to earthand revealedit in portions to the prophet 
throughout his 23 years of prophet  hood.  
3. He taught the prophet how to recite the Holy Quran correctly. He  would  
4. He assisted the p</pre>
