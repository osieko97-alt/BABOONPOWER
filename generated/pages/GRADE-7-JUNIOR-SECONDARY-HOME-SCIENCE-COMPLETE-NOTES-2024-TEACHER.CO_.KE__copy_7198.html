a. Food Nutrients  
Nutrients are the substances in food that our bodies process to enable it to 
function. Your nutrient requirements are influenced by factors including your 
age, growth stage and activity. Nutrients are so small that the naked eye c an’t see 
them.  
 
Role of Home science in contemporary life  
(i) Use of scientific knowledge in managing Home life:  
Great advances have been made in the areas of health, nutrition, textile, psychology, 
housing and managerial skills, which the home maker requires in her day -to-day life of 
managing and maintaining the household. Hence, it is essential that such knowledge 
and skills are made available to every home maker for creating a health, happy and 
enriched family life.  
(ii) Use of available services and facilities:  
Modern day society has changed a great deal in terns of availability of various services 
to each and every household. Therefore, a formal and systematic approach of 
understanding and utilizing these services has become necessary as a prepar ation for 
home making. Moreover, use of modern technologies, its maintenance and 
management also is of great importance, which Home science education tries to fulfill.  
(iii) Economic necessities:  
More and more women are working outside the home due to basi cally economic 
necessities. In this context, managing and balancing both household and 


3 | P a g e         “Re -i n v e n t i n g  C B C  f o r  b e t t e r  s o l u t i o n s ”  
 professional life is essential. Home science education tries to train and educate 
one to make a perfect interface between these two spheres of women’s life.  
(iv) Managin g day to day family affairs:  
Human relations are undergoing sea - change during the last few decades. Family 
values, ethos are severely affected. People are becoming more and more individualistic 
in nature, contrary to our Indian collectivism. Thus children  are growing up in a very 
complex psychological environment and thus leading to very many problems found 
among children in general and the problems of working women, elderly people in 
particular. Today family problems are in rise, leading to various types of domestic 
violence, abuse, crimes etc. Home Science education tries to educate and acquire the 
ability to manage this crisis at right time with proper emphasis.  
(v) Preparing for a healthier and purposeful life:  
Happiness and Peace in the family are the goals of purposeful family life. Home science 
education tries to create an environment and outlook, which will enable people to live 
richer and more purposeful lives. It tries to provide a wholesome knowledge and 
attitudes towards family health (both physi cal and psychological), nutrition, child care, 
home decoration, use of clothing’s, elderly care and management during risk and 
eventualities. It tries further to enrich the lives of each and every members of the family 
through better understanding of the h uman relationships.  
(vi) Family Life Education:  
Home science education helps in preparing for home making, in the development of 
right values, appreciation, and understanding for better family life. It enables the pupils 
to understand the functions of parenthood, responsibilities of family membership and 
management of one’s resources. It helps them to develop a sound philosophy of 
personal and family living. Understanding oneself (in terms of strengths and 
weaknesses) and others is the basic essence of family life. Moreover, it helps us in 
careful weighing of and balancing competing demands and making intelligent 
selections and decisions.  
Thus, the objective of Home science education is to foster the growth, development and 
wellbeing of individual’s fami lies and communities, utilising the findings and advances 
of science and technology. The overall objectives of Home science education aim at:  
1. To foster the growth, development and well -being of individuals, families and 
communities in utilizing the find ings and advances of science and technology.  
2. To achieve family happiness and overall well -being of the society.  
(vii) The study of Home Science familiarizes us with the household problems and the 
ways to solve them.

 (viii) Home science is an art and sci ence. It teaches us to do all the household jobs in a 
systematic and scientific manner. For example, it teaches us not only to cook food, but 
also teaches how to provide nutritive food to all members of the family economically.  
 It also teaches us the art o f managing jobs like cleanliness, washing of clothes, etc. 
by spending less time and energy. These days, the market is flooded by a large 
variety of garments. A student of home science can make proper selection and 
maintenance of these clothes.  
 Home Scienc e teaches us about the child development and human relationship. In 
child development, the students are taught about the physical, mental, social, and 
emotional development of the child. This knowledge helps us to know whether the 
child is growing at prope r rate or not. The student learns to control his emotions 
and to adjust in the society well.  
 The study of Home Science helps us to become a conscious consumer so that we 
should know our duties and rights as a consumer and not easily exploited by the 
seller s. 
 In earlier times, the duties of a housewife were confined to home only but these 
days because of modernization and socialization, she is also working outdoors. The 
knowledge of home science helps her to manage resources like time, energy, skill, 
interes t, etc. efficiently so that she can do all the household chores along with her 
outdoor duties.  
Guidelines for Nutrient conservation during food preparation and cooking  
CONSERVATION OF NUTRIENTS IN PREPAR ATION AND COOKING OF VEGETABLES  
Loss of nutrients in vegetables begin from preparation onward and is grea ter 
during the cooking process.  
1.     When fruits and vegetables are peeled the vitamins present und er the skin 
may be lost.  

5 | P a g e         “Re -i n v e n t i n g  C B C  f o r  b e t t e r  s o l u t i o n s ”  
 2.     Nutrients are also lost when the edible leaves of carrot beetroot and o uter 
layer of cabbage are discarded.  
3.     Vitamin B complex and Vitamin C are water soluble and are lost when the 
water in which vegetables are cooked is discarded. Sodium, potassium and chlorine 
are also lost w hen cooking water is discarded.  
4.     Vita min C is lost by ox idation due to exposure of air.  
5.     During dehydration ascor bic acid and carotene are lost.  
6.     Addition of soda results in heavy loss of B - Vitamins during cooking.  
Guidelines to minimize nutrient  losses during preparation:  
1. Wash vegetables before cutting. Soaking or washing time should be 
reduced to minimize nutrient loss.  
 
The kitchen rule is to always wash the vegetables first and then chop them 
rather than doing the other way around. Chopping first and washing afterward 
can take away vital nutrients from the food.  
2. Cut vegetables into big pieces so that exposure of vitamins to water is less 
while cooking and washing.  
 


6 | P a g e         “Re -i n v e n t i n g  C B C  f o r  b e t t e r  s o l u t i o n s ”  
 3. Use a vegetable peeler to remove skin as it helps remove only a very thin 
layer of skin. (This especially for  Root vegetables)  
Vegetables  that have roots, like potatoes  and carrots should be 
boiled with skins on and then peeled after boiling as it will help the nutrients  to migrate to 
the center of the vegetables  and help in their retention  within. 
Soaking 
If you soak vegetables  in water for a long period then, almost 40% of 
soluble vitamins  and minerals are lost. If you really have to soak them, use the remaining  
water as vegetable  stock, or to knead the dough, prepare soups and gravies. 
4.     Use minimum wat er for cooking. Bring the water to boil and add the vegetables 
to cook.  
5.     Cook vegetables by steaming and pressure -cooking to conse rve nutrients.  
6.     Cover the vessel with a lid while  cooking as it hastens cooking.  
7.     Do not use soda while cook ing vegetables as  it destroys valuable vitamins.  
 Baking soda makes cooking water alkaline and thus helps retain 
the colour of vegetables as well as speed up the cooking process, but it destroys 
vitamin C content of the veggies.  


7 | P a g e         “Re -i n v e n t i n g  C B C  f o r  b e t t e r  s o l u t i o n s ”  
 8.     Vegetables salads s hould be prepared just before serving to conserve nutrient s. 
9.     Use acids such as lime juice or vinegar to salads as it prevents loss of Vitamin 
C since Vitamin C is stable in acid.  
 
10. Excess water  
Use the excess water of boiled rice or vegetables 
in preparing gravies, kneading the dough as it is loaded with a lot of nutrients.  
11. Cooking time  
 The longer the cooking time and the higher the temperature, the 
more nutrients are destroyed as most of the vitamins are sensitive to heat and air exposure.  
Blanching during cooking

Whether cooking certain recipes or preparing to preserve produce,  blanching  is often a 
recommended technique. That&#x27;s because certain fruits and vegetables, such as cauliflower, 
green beans, and tomatoes, benefit from this simple process that quickly cooks the food and 
then abruptly stops the cooking. To blanch, food is briefly immersed in boiling water (often just 
a minute or two), followed by an ice bath to rapidly cool off the food. Blanching is used both 
by home cooks and in in</pre>
