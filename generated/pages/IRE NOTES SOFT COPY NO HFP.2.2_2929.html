FORM TWO  
 
Ulumul Qur’an   
 
 CHAPTER ONE: QUR’AN  
 
 
In Book One, we defined Ulumul Qur’an as a scientific study dealing with various 
fields related to Quran. Can you mention some of the components included in this 
scientific study? From the various components, you have mentioned above, we shall 
learn about Wahyi.  
Wahyi is an Arabic terminology, which comes from the root word ‘Awha’ , which 
means inspiring, giving direction or guidance on a n issue. Technically, it refers to the 
methods or ways through which Allah (SWT) used to communicate to the prophets 
and other creatures.  
As you are aware, communication is an important tool for human beings. 
Communication between human beings or creatures  may take different forms. Can 
you mention some of the ways through which this communication takes place? You 
will realize that the modes of communication between the human beings are different 
from those observed in the animals and other creatures. Likewi se, Allah (SWT) has 
His own ways of sending information to the creatures as He says in the Qur’an:  
“It is not fitting for a man that Allah (SWT) should speak to him except by 
inspiration, or from behind a veil, or by sending a messenger to reveal with Alla h 
(SWT)’s permission what Allah (SWT) wills: For He is Most High, Most Wise.” [Q 
42:51]  

| P a g e 157  
 Let us now look at some examples of this communication:  
1. When Nabi Ibrahim broke the idols, his people decided to set him on fire 
but Allah (SWT) inspired the fire to be cool on him. The following verse 
of the Qur’an gives this inspiration of Allah (SWT) to the fire . “We 
(Allah (SWT)) said: ‘O fire! Be you coolness and safety for Ibrahim 
(Abraham)” [Q 21:69] this is a form of communication from Alla h 
(SWT) to the fire.  
2. The dry earth is inspired by Allah (SWT) to give produce for the human 
beings so that they can have food for nourishment from it. Allah (SWT) 
says, “And a sign for them is the dead land. We give it life and We  bring 
forth from it grain s so that they eat thereof.” [Q 36:33]  
3. Allah (SWT) inspired the Hoopoe (Hud Hud) with knowledge of detecting  the 
acts of shirk committed by the Queen of Saba’ (Bilqis) and the ability to report it to 
Nabi Suleiman. Read this from Qur’an 27:30 -37. Can you identify more verses in 
the Qur’an where Allah (SWT) sends messages to his creatures and prophets?  
Modes of Wahyi  
The examples we have seen above show that Allah (SWT) can communicate to His 
creatures in various ways. The ways through which Allah (SWT) com municated to 
His Prophets can be divided into two; Direct and Indirect modes.  
Direct Mode  
In this mode of Wahyi, Allah (SWT) speaks directly to the prophet without sending a 
messenger (Angel). The prophets would hear Allah (SWT)’s voice without seeing his 
image. Can you give examples of Prophets to whom Allah (SWT) spoke to directly? 
This form of Wahyi includes the following:  
1. As spoken words behind a  veil 
A veil is a form of barrier which is intended to block the Prophet from seeing Allah 
(SWT) during the process of revelation. For example, during the Night of Isra Wal 
Miiraj the prophet spoke to Allah (SWT) at ‘Arsh behind a veil of a cloud. In Sura A’ 
Taha (Q 20:9 -14) Allah (SWT) speaks to prophet Musa (AS) behind a veil of fire. Can  

| P a g e 158  
 you find out other surahs where Allah (SWT) communicated to Prophet Musa (AS) 
from behind a veil of fire?  
2. Through  inspiration  
Inspiration is a spiritual expe rience where one is guided by Allah (SWT) to do 
something good. The Prophets were inspired through guided visions of events taking 
place when they were fully awake in the form of Wahyi. One would consciously 
become an active participant while following ord ers to do a given action. For 
example:  
Allah (SWT) inspired Nabi Issah to speak at infancy when his mother was accused of 
being unchaste. Allah (SWT) says, “He (Issah) said: ‘Verily I am a slave of Allah 
(SWT), He has given me the scripture and made me a P rophet; And He Has made me 
blessed wheresoever I be, and Has enjoined on me Swalat (prayer), and Zakat, as 
long as I live. And dutiful to my mother, and made me not arrogant, unblest. And 
Salaam (peace) be upon me the day I was born, and the day I die and the day I shall 
be arisen alive.” [Q 19:33]  
Find out more examples of revelation through inspiration to the following Prophets: 
Prophet Musa (AS), Adam (AS), Yunus (AS), Nuh (AS) and Ibrahim (AS). We shall 
learn more about some of these Prophets in Chapter  three.  
 
Indirect Mode  
The indirect mode of Wahyi is shown when Allah (SWT) uses an intermediary subject 
that bridges the gap between Him and His prophet. A link is used to transmit the 
message to the intended prophet. It takes two forms which we shall dis cuss below:  
1. Through Angel Jibril  (AS)  
In Form one, we learnt about the Angels and their duties. Do you remember the 
Angel who is in charge of revelation? Can you recall how Angel Jibril would 
appear to the Prophet while he was in the cave of Hira? In this instance, Allah 
(SWT) had send Angel Jibril to bring His message to the Prophet.  

| P a g e 159  
 Allah (SWT) created Angel Jibril (AS) and gave him the role of taking His 
divine message to the prophets. He used to take the message to the prophets 
without  tempering with it. Allah (SWT) says, “Say ( O Muhammad) Ruhul 
Qudus [Jibril] has brought it down (the Qur’an) from your Lord with truth and 
it may make firm and strengthen (the faith of) those who believe, and as a 
guidance and glad tidings to those who h ave submitted (to Allah (SWT) as 
Muslims) [Q16:102] You can also refer to Quran [Q 2:97]  
2. Through  dream  
A dream is a form of visualization of events while one is in a sleep. Human 
beings often have dreams during sleep. Events in these dreams might turn out to 
be true but many a time they are not true. A true dream is guidance from Allah 
(SWT) to a chosen person.  
Several prophets used to get guidance in the form of dreams. Prophet Yusuf 
(AS), for example, told his father “(Remember) When Yusuf (Joseph) said t o his 
father: “O my father! Verily, I saw (in a dream) eleven stars and the sun and 
the moon -I saw them prostrating themselves to me.” [Q 12:4] His father warned 
him not to reveal the dream to his brothers because it was a sign and a 
revelation from Allah (SWT) that he had been chosen by Allah (SWT) among 
the family of Yaqub as a great leader, interpreter of dreams and a  prophet.  
Prophet Ibrahim (AS) also saw in a dream Allah (SWT) commanding him to 
offer his son (Ismail) as a sacrifice. Allah (SWT) says, “And when he (his son) 
was old enough to walk with him, he said: ‘O my son! I have seen in a dream 
that I am slaughtering you (offering you in sacrifice to Allah (SWT)). So look 
what you think!’ He said: ‘O my father! Do that which you are commanded, 
insha Allah (if Allah (SWT) wills), you shall find me of as -Sabirun (patient) 
then, when they had both submitted themselves (to the will of Allah (SWT), and 
he had laid him prostrate on his forehead (or on the side of his forehead for 
slaughtering); We called ou t to him: ‘O Ibrahim!(Abraham!) You have fulfilled  

| P a g e 161  
 the dream!’ Verily, thus do We reward the Muhsinun (good doers) verily, that 
indeed was the manifest trial.” [Q 37:102 -106] 
 
The modes of Wahyi can be summarized using the following diagram

Revelation of the Qur’an  
Read Qur’an [Q: 1 163 -165] 
In Book one, we learnt the various roles played by Angel Jibril in the revelation of the 
Qur’an. ran you recall some of the roles he played? It is important to note that his role 
did not only start with the revelation of the Qur’an to the Prophet but he first had to 
lower it from Lawhil Mahfudh , the well preserved Tablet (a tablet is a flat pi ece of 
stone that has words written on it) to a station in the lowest heaven referred to as  I D

 &quot;Bayt al -&#x27;Izzah&quot;  (The House of Honor or Power). During this process, Allah (SWT) 
brought down the Qur’an in one volume. From the above explanation, we learn that 
the Qur’an was send down in two stages. Let us now look at each of these stages:  
 
Stage One : From Lawhul Mafud h to Baitul Izzah  
 
Before the Qur’an reached the hrophet, Allah (SWT) had preserved it in the heavens. 
Do you know the name of the tablet on which the Quran was Preserved? Allah (SWT) 
says in the Qur’an &quot;Nay! This is a Glorious Qur’an, inscribed in a Prese rved Tablet&quot; 
[Q 85:21 -22] 
 
Here, Allah (SWT) sent Angel Jibril (AS) to bring the Qur’an from Lauhil Mahfudh, 
the well Preserved Tablet (in the Seventh Heaven) down to the First Heaven (sky) and 
placed it in Baitul Izza, &#x27;Place of Power or Honor&#x27;.  
 
The Qur’ an mentions the Preserved Tablet and tells us that it was sent down during a 
specific night. Allah (SWT) says, &quot;Verily, We have sent it (this Quran) down in the 
Night of Al Qadr (Decree).&quot; [Q 97:1].  
 
Allah (SWT) also says , &quot;By the Book that makes things cl ear; - We sent it down 
during a Blessed Night: for We (ever) wish to warn (against Evil). In the (Night) is 
made distinct every affair of wisdom.&quot; [Qur’an 11:2 -4] These two verses show that the 
Holy Qur’an was revealed in a single blessed night in the mont h of Ramadhan, the 
‘Night of hower’. ran you find out more about the night of power in surah al Alaq [Q 
97:2-5]? 
 
 
 
 
Stage Two: From Baitul Izza to the Prophet  
 
Baitul Izza (the house of honour) is found in the lowest heavens. After the Qur’an had 
been lowered down from Lawhul Mahfudh, Allah (SWT) instructed Angel Jibril (AS) 
to send it down to the Prophet (SWT) over the twenty three year period of his 
Prophethood. The verses were revealed gradually from Baitul Izza in order to provide 
the required guida nce to mankind.
