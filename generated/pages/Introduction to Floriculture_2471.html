<pre>--- Slide 1 ---
Introduction to Floriculture
Advanced Plant Sciences:  Horticulture and Forestry
Sutherlin High School AST
W. Crawford

--- Slide 2 ---
Floriculture
What does floriculture include?
Floral design
Flower and plant care and identification
Proper use of chemicals and tools
Selling and marketing floral products

--- Slide 3 ---
Floriculture
For this unit we will:
Learn principles of design
Identify floral plants, pests, and tools
Prepare floral centerpieces, boutonnieres, and corsages
Unit Evaluation:  written test OR participate in district floriculture CDE

--- Slide 4 ---
The Flower Industry
Most flowers imported from other countries
90% of carnations
89% of chrysanthemums
71% of roses
Growth of Sales in the Cut Flower Market

--- Slide 5 ---
The Flower Industry
Most are grown in the Netherlands
In hydroponic greenhouses
20 years ahead of most countries in production systems
Other countries
Colombia
Latin America
Percentage of World Cut Flower Exports by Country

--- Slide 6 ---
The Flower Industry
How do they get to you?
Colombian carnations, Hawaiian tropical flowers, Israeli roses, and other cut flowers are air shipped to Holland flower auctions by exporters
Inspected by and sold to buyers from around the world, who ship them to their home countries
Arrive to wholesalers who distribute to retailers/etc

--- Slide 8 ---
The Flower Industry
Oregon’s Role
Oregon produces mostly horticulture and nursery plants, not cut flowers for arrangement products
But almost all Easter Lilies in US are produced on southern Oregon coast

--- Slide 9 ---
Floral Design:  the Basics
Floral design – (aka arranging); the art of organizing the design elements inherent in plant materials and accessories according to principles of design art


--- Slide 10 ---
Floral Design:  the Basics
Principles of design – rules and guidelines used by the floral designer to create a beautiful composition


--- Slide 11 ---
Principles of Design
Proportion is the pleasing relationship between size and shape among objects and parts of objects
How do you achieve proportion?
The design should be 1 ½ times the size of the container’s greatest dimension (height/width)
Some exceptions
Container is the primary factor
Dimensions
Color
Texture/material
Shape

--- Slide 12 ---
Principles of Design
How do you achieve proportion?
Solid, dark colored containers can support taller arrangements
Clear glass is better for shorter arrangements

--- Slide 13 ---
Principles of Design
Balance in a flower arrangement refers to the arrangement’s equilibrium and equality in weight, both physical and visual 
How do you achieve balance?
Physical balance:  actual stability of plants in arrangement
Visual balance:  perception of the arrangement being balanced–being equal in weight on both sides of the central axis


--- Slide 14 ---
Principles of Design
How do you achieve balance?
Visual balance should be evident from three views: 
side to side
top to bottom
front to back


--- Slide 15 ---
Principles of Design
Rhythm is the orderly organization of a design elements to create a visual pathway
How do you achieve rhythm?
Regular, repeated rhythm is present when materials are repeated at regular intervals from the top to the bottom of an arrangement
Free, variable rhythm is an unstructured style with subtle flowing movements created with unstructured materials


--- Slide 16 ---
Principles of Design
How do you achieve rhythm?
Five principles help with rhythm:
Radiation is the design element that makes it look as if all stems are coming from one point
Repetition is repeating the use of floral design elements to create unity in the work
Transition is the smooth gradual change from one material or element to another
Variation is the diverse assortment of materials, stimulating interest
Contrast describes objects arranged with a striking difference, stimulating interest



--- Slide 17 ---
Principles of Design
Dominance in a design means that one design element is more prevalent or noticeable, thereby capturing interest of the viewer
How do you achieve dominance?
Dominance can be achieved by:
Using dominant plant material
Using an emphasized design element
Using a distinct style of design
Using a theme
Using a focal point – the center of interest of the design, visually tying it together; all arrangements should have some sort of focal point


--- Slide 18 ---
Principles of Design
How do you achieve dominance?
A focal point is done by:
Use of large flowers
Use of special form flowers such as orchids
Employing dark shades
Variation of concentration of plant material
Use of framing materials
Use of strong color contrast
Radiation of plantmaterials to a particular area
Use of accessories

--- Slide 19 ---
Other Considerations
Shape and Form
Shape is the 2-dimensional outline
Form is the 3-dimensional aspect
Geometric
Naturalistic
Free form

--- Slide 21 ---
Other Considerations
Shape and Form
Line – visual movement between two points in the arrangements
Line materials – create definite vertical, horizontal, diagonal, or curvilinear lines
Form flowers – have distinctive shapes (lillies, tropicals)

--- Slide 22 ---
Other Considerations
Shape and Form
Line – visual movement between two points in the arrangements
Mass flowers – round solid flowers like carnations/mums
Filler flowers – airy, light flowers like baby’s breath

--- Slide 23 ---
Other Considerations
Color
Primary – red, yellow, blue
Secondary – green, orange, purple
Tertiary – blue-green, yellow-orange, etc.


--- Slide 25 ---
Other Considerations
Color Schemes
Monochromatic – all the same color, lighter/darker
Analagous – color scheme with colors next to one another on the color wheel
Complimentary – colors opposite from one another on the color wheel

--- Slide 27 ---
Proportion – is the proportion correct?
Balance – is it balanced?
Rhythm – how does your design have rhythm?
Dominance – what is the focal point?</pre>
