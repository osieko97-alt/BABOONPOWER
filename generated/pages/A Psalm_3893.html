This story contains different sorts of truths. 
Because it is a narrative set in a real time and place it has some literal truths. (eg Jerusalem, The Temple, the Passover.)
Because this is a narrative it tells other truths about attitudes and values, about life, about relationships, about people and about God. 
Because it was written to persuade people to know Jesus as God in human form, it contains truths of our faith – truths about Jesus.

The family or a group of men would choose the sacrificial lamb and bring it to the Temple to be slaughtered. It had to be a perfect lamb, with no blemishes. 
The priest would slaughter the lamb and give the people bitter herbs and unleavened bread to eat. After evening prayers, meat would be taken from the cooked lamb. The people would be ready: loins girded, sandals on, staves in hand. They would eat… in haste…and anything found next morning would be burned.

There are some interesting phrases and words in this passage. 
‘12 years old’ 
In Jewish law a child was ready to take responsibility for the observance of their faith between ten and thirteen. 
‘the boy Jesus stayed in Jerusalem’
Jesus was not left behind by careless parent – he chose to stay in Jerusalem. The words imply a deliberate action on the part of Jesus. 
‘relatives and acquaintances’
Those travelling to Jerusalem from the same village would have travelled together as a party or caravan. As a result, Jesus’ relatives and friends would have been with Mary and Joseph – it was therefore quite likely that the young man was with his friends.

‘3 days later’
At a literal level, the number indicates that Jesus was missing for some time. Symbolically, the number makes us think of the resurrection, when Jesus will again be lost for 3 days. 
‘my father’s affairs’
This passage may translated in different ways. Some Bible’s say ‘my father’s house’, others say ‘my father’s things’. The best translation makes it clear that Jesus is not just passively visiting God’s house, he is actually doing God’s work. Jesus is engaged in an activity – he is doing what he does best – answering questions.
