<pre>Home Science may seem like a totally new area to you, since there is no subject known as &#x27;Home Science&#x27; in the Primary School Curriculum. However, you actually covered it under Science and this includes topics such as, the Human Body, Health Education, Foods and Nutrition, among others.

Just as you enjoyed learning the above topics in Science while in Primary School, I am sure you will enjoy learning Home Science as a subject on its own in Secondary School.

The following sub-topics will be covered in this topic:

Basic sewing tools and equipment

The sewing machine

Introduction

Needlework requires the use of some special tools and equipment which are categorized into two main groups:
Small and Large : needed for:-

Sewing Machine

A sewing machine is a large sewing equipment designed to make stitches. It makes sewing quicker and more efficient.It is a simple machine to operate as it is done manually at the speed of the person operating.

It is portable and easy to carry.
Balance wheel is rotated by hand.
One hand rotates the hand wheel while the other guides the material.
Hand Machine 
The following video clip shows the working of a hand machine:
Treadle Machine

Feet rotate the hand wheel
Both hands are free to guide the work
Bulky and hence takes up a lot of storage space
A motor can be fixed onto it to make it electric

Care of the sewing machine

Ensure servicing of machines regularly.
Store the machine while covered to avoid dust from entering.
Clean and oil it regularly.
Learners should use the machine under supervision.
Do not machine over pins to avoid breaking the needle.
