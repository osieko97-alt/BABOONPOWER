Visual arts  -creative art forms appreciated through sense of sight such as;  
 Drawing.

 Play - a written work that tells a story through action and speech and is meant to be acted on a 
stage.   
 Music - Music is a collection of coordinated sound or sounds. Making music is the process of 
putting sounds and tones in an order, often combining them to create a unified composition  


 
 Dance – dance is the movement of the body in a rhythmic way, usually to music and within a 
given space, for the purpose of expressing an idea or emotion.  
Principles of Visual arts .  
There are two principles of visual arts nam ely:  
1. Principle of dominance.  
2. Principle of proportion.  
 
1. Principle of dominance(emphasis) in Visual Arts.  
 Dominance is when a single element is so large and/or different compared to the rest of the design 
that it dominates. It grabs your attention.   
 It contributes to organic unity by emphasizing the fact that there is one main feature and that other 
elements are subordinate to it  
 Famous examples include the London Eye that dominates the skyline of London or the Ashoka 
Lions that dominate the Indian Passp ort and other official documents.  
 
 
 
      


 
 
2. Principle of Proportion in Visual arts.  
Proportion  refers to the dimensions of a composition and relationships between height, width and 
depth. How proportion is used will affect how realistic or stylized. Proportion also describes how the 
sizes of different parts of a piece of art or design relate to eac h other.  
Proportion in any art is the relative size of objects in relation to each other or corresponding to the 
other elements as a whole.   
 
Basic Elements of a play.  
 Theme  - What is the meaning of theme in element of drama?  
The theme refers to the message (meaning) that is intended to be expressed in the story. In other 
words, it is the main idea or the lesson to be learned from the story. Examples of themes in plays 
include: justice, loyalty. drugs, bullying, human rights et c.  
 
 Character - this is a person or individual taking part in the play or drama that may have defined 
personal qualities and/or histories.  
 Plot- A plot is a sequence of events within a play that tells a story. A plot is what makes a story. 
Five components  make up a plot: exposition, rising action, climax, falling action, and resolution. 
Conflict and theme help drive the plot forward.  

 Language - Language in drama is represented as spoken language or, in other words, as speech.  
In drama, language refers to t he particular manner of verbal expression, the diction or style of 
writing, or the speech or phrasing that suggests a class or profession or type of character.  
 Setting - The setting is the time and place in which the story takes place  
 
Elements of Music in Creative Arts.  
 Sound -any tone with characteristics such as controlled pitch and timbre 
  Rhythm Rhythm 
is the pattern of sound, silence, and emphasis in a song 
  Melody - a melody is a 
combination of pitch and rhythm.  
 Harmony -harmony,  in music, the sound of two or more notes heard simultaneously.   
Elements of Dance in Creative Arts.  
 Body  - In dance, the body is the mobile figure or shape, felt by the dancer, seen by others. The 
body is sometimes relatively still and sometimes changin g as the dancer moves in place or 
travels through the dance area. The body is the mobile instrument of the dancer and helps inform 
us of what is moving.  
  
 Action – This is what a dancer does, for example travelling, turning, elevation, gesture, stillness, 
use of body parts, floor -work and the transference of weight.  
 Space refers to the area through which the dancer&#x27;s body moves.  

 Time  - It is an essential part of choreographing and performing dance. It helps us to stay together 
when we dance in unison, identify the beat and the rhythm of how we move and provide stimulus 
for choreography.

Endurance and agility of physical  
Agility  
This is the ability to move and change the direction and position of the body quickly and effectively 
while under control.  
It requires quick reflexes, coordination, balance, speed, and correct response to the changing situation.  
Agility training has been included in several endurance training programs. Maximum oxygen 
consumption rate is a direct measurement of an individual&#x27;s endurance capacity and its relationship to 
agility has not been studied.  
Endurance - refers to your body&#x27;s physical capability to sustain an exercise for an extended period. It&#x27;s 
made up of two components:  
 cardiovascular endurance

Pitch

waves producing it.  
 
 
Bass staff  
On the bass clef, the notes going through the lines on the staff (from the bottom up) are G, B, D, F and 
A. To make it easy to remember these no tes, we use the sentence “Good Boy Deserves Fruit Always”. 
The notes going through the spaces on the bass clef (from the bottom up) are A, C, E, and G.  
1. Lines: The lines of the bass staff, from bottom to top, correspond to the notes G, B, D, F, and A. A 
handy phrase to remember this is “Good Boys Do Fine Always”.  
2. Spaces: The spaces, from the lowest to the highest, represent the notes A, C, E, and G.  
 
 
 
 
A ledger line  

This is a small line that extends the stave when we run out of room. With the ledger line drawn, we 
can place the A. Next, let&#x27;s discuss the Bass Clef (also called the F Clef). The staff line in between the 
two dots of the clef is F.
