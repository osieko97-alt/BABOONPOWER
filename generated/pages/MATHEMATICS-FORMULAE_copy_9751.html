PREFACE
 
The Shomato Han
dbook of Mathematics
 
formulas is a quick refere
nce aid for K.C.S.E students. This complete 
revision course for K.C.S.E
 
contains more than 
------------
 
of the most useful formulas and hints and equations found 
and necessary in the K.C.S.E four years course, covering mathematic
s
.
 
The exhaustive contents pages, allows the required formulas to be located swiftly and simply by the students. All 
variables invol
v
ed in formulas 
have
 
been accurately identified.
 
The Handbook is designed to be a compact, portable reference
 
book suitable 
for everyday work, problem solving, or 
examination revision for all students from form one to form four.
 
All students and teachers in mathematics and physics will want to have this essential reference book within reach.
 
Yaa K.W.S is a seasoned teacher of 
M
athematics
 
and Physics, having taught thes
e
 
two subjects for over twenty years 
now. He is also a K.N.E
.C examiner for K.C.S.E Physics 
paper three for many years. His valuable experience will go a 
long way to 
helping students in Kenya
.
 
Yaa K.W.S was the 
H.O.D Physical sciences in Khamis High school, Mombas
a County. He became the Deputy 
P
rincipal of the same school
 
years back and
 
is currently the Principal of Mwakirunge secondary school, teaching
