Presentation Outline
Paper-Based Input Systems
Paperless Input Systems
Paper-Based Processing Systems
Paperless Processing Systems
The Output System

--- Slide 3 ---
I. Paper-Based Input Systems
        A.  Preparation and Completion of the 
              Source Document.
        B.  Transfer of Source Documents to 
              Data Processing
        C.  Data Entry
        D.  Program Data Editing


--- Slide 4 ---
A.  Preparation and Completion of the Source Document
Source documents such as sales orders are filled in manually.  Errors are minimized if source documents are well designed and easy to understand.

--- Slide 5 ---
B.  Transfer of Source Documents to Data Processing
Input Document Control Form 
       Provides batch control totals for batches of   
       input data transmitted between user and data 
       processing departments.  Monitors completeness of processing.  See Figure 6.1 on page 196.
Data Transfer Log
       Provides control over the disposition and use of transferred data.


See Fig. 6-2 on p. 197

--- Slide 6 ---
C.  Data Entry
Key verification takes place to ensure accurate data entry.  This involves typing in the data twice.  As the data is typed in a second time, key verification software verifies that the second keying matches the previous input already on the disk file.  A process of visual verification is less effective.

--- Slide 7 ---
D.  Program Data Editing
Program data editing is a software technique used to screen data for errors prior to processing.  Examples include:
Table Lookup – Entry must match values in a table.  (Example: valid customer number)
Limit Test – Entry must not exceed an extreme value.  (Example: number of payroll hours)
Continuous operations auditing – Unacceptable entries are separated and held in suspense until verified or corrected.
Check digit – Redundant digit determined by a mathematical calculation.  (See illustration on p. 198)

II. Paperless Input Systems
Loss of Internal Controls
Paperless Input Systems Requiring Human Intervention
Paperless Input Systems Requiring No 
Human Intervention


--- Slide 9 ---
A.  Loss of Internal Controls
Transaction logs (registers) – Logs all inputs to a special file that automatically contains tags to identify transactions.
Tagging – Provides an audit trail by including additional audit-type information with transaction data.  Audit-type information might include dates and user authorization codes.
In on-line input systems, the need for keying in source documents may be eliminated.  The loss of paper-based internal controls can be compensated for by:

--- Slide 10 ---
B.  Paperless Input Systems Requiring Human Intervention
On-line manual data-entry systems
	Users manually type transactions into the computer system.
Automatic Identification System
	Merchandise and other items such as credit cards are tagged with machine-readable codes.

--- Slide 11 ---
EDI
C.  Paperless Input Systems Requiring No Human Intervention
In some systems, transactions are processed from beginning to end without any human intervention.
An example would be a system that monitors inventory levels and places an order directly with a supplier’s system that automatically initiates shipment of the needed goods.

--- Slide 12 ---
III. Paper-Based Processing Systems

	Virtually all paper-based systems for processing transactions are batch oriented.
Batch Processing with Sequential File Updating
Son-Father-Grandfather Master Files
Batch Processing with Random-Access  File Updating


--- Slide 13 ---
A.  Batch Processing with Sequential File Updating
Four steps include:
Preparing the transaction file – Data is 
      edited, validated, and sorted in the same sequence as the master file.
Updating the master file (subsidiary records) – Transaction file records are matched with master file records, and a new master file is created with updated data.
Updating the general ledger – Master file changes are updated in the general ledger.  Documented with journal vouchers.
Preparing general ledger reports – Trial balances and other reports are produced.
See Fig. 6-3 on p. 202

--- Slide 15 ---
C.  Batch-Processing with Random-Access File Updating
Individual records are read one by one from the transaction file and used to update the related records in the master file.  It is not necessary to:
Sort the transaction file in the same order as 
      the master file.
Generate a new master file.
A backup of the master file should exist before the updating begins.

--- Slide 16 ---
IV. Paperless Processing Systems
Characteristics of Paperless Processing Systems
Batch Processing in Paperless Processing Systems
Methods of Real-time Processing in Paperless Processing Systems
Components of Real-Time Sales Systems

--- Slide 17 ---
A.  Characteristics of Paperless Processing Systems
Two primary characteristics include:
Either batch or real-time processing is possible.
With most types of on-line real-time processing, individual transactions are processed as they are input into the system.  Under such a system master files are always up to date.

--- Slide 18 ---
B.  Batch Processing in Paperless Processing Systems
Batch processing in paperless processing systems is similar to batch processing in paper-based systems except that:
Journal vouchers are replaced by electronic 
      equivalents.
Periodic batch runs automatically update the general ledger.



--- Slide 19 ---
C.  Methods of On-Line, Real-time Processing in Paperless Processing Systems
Inquiry/response systems – Users request information but do not input data for processing.
Data entry systems – Users interactively input data that is processed periodically in batches.
File processing systems – Users interactively input data that is immediately processed against relevant master files.
Full or transaction processing systems – Similar to file processing systems except that the entire transaction is completed when input.  For example, an invoice is generated in addition to updating accounts receivable.

--- Slide 20 ---
D. Components of Real-Time Sales Systems
Point-of-Sale (POS) System – to allow data collection at the point where the sale is completed, the traditional cash register is enhanced to allow it to function as the source data-entry device for sales transactions.
Bar-Coding Technology – scanner technology and machine-readable bar codes such as UPC.
EDI Ordering System – allows direct computer-to-computer exchange of business information and documents for placing orders and facilitating quick shipment.  

--- Slide 21 ---
V. The Output System

        A.  The Purpose of Output Controls
        B.  Examples of Output Controls
The output system can be paper-based, paperless, or something in between.  Most paper-based batch-oriented systems with sequential file processing produce very large volumes of output.  In contrast, on-line, real-time paperless systems tend to produce very little output.

--- Slide 22 ---
A.  The Purpose of Output Controls
Output controls are designed to ensure that processing results in valid output and that outputs are properly distributed.

--- Slide 23 ---
B.  Examples of Output Controls
Control totals should be balanced to control     
      totals generated independently of data processing.
Internal audit often sets up an EDP control group that makes sure that errors are corrected, and that controls are instituted to avoid repeat situations.
An output distribution register is maintained to control the distribution of reports.

--- Slide 24 ---
Summary
Paper-based input systems maintain the traditional audit trail.
Paperless input systems lose some internal controls that can be accomplished through transaction logs and tagging.
Paper-based processing systems are usually batch oriented.
Paperless processing systems may be batch or real time.
Output systems should ensure valid output and proper distribution of information.
