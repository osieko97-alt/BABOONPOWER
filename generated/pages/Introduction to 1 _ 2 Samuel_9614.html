Decline of Judges
In that day I will perform against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house, from beginning to end.   For I have told him that I will judge his house forever for the iniquity which he knows, because his sons made themselves vile, and he did not restrain them.
– 1 Samuel 3:12,13 NKJV

--- Slide 15 ---

Decline of Judges
And Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.  He went from year to year on a circuit to Bethel, Gilgal, and Mizpah, and judged Israel in all those places.
– 1 Samuel 7:15,16 NKJV

--- Slide 16 ---
16
Rise of Kings
Now it came to pass when Samuel was old that he made his sons judges over Israel.  But his sons did not walk in his ways; they turned aside after dishonest gain, took bribes, and perverted justice.
Then all the elders of Israel gathered together and came to Samuel at Ramah, and said to him, “Look, you are old, and your sons do not walk in your ways. Now make us a king to judge us like all the nations.”
– 1 Samuel 8:1,3-5 NKJV

--- Slide 17 ---
17
Rise of Kings
But the thing displeased Samuel when they said, “Give us a king to judge us.” So Samuel prayed to the LORD.  And the LORD said to Samuel, “Heed the voice of the people in all that they say to you; for they have not rejected you, but they have rejected Me, that I should not reign over them.
– 1 Samuel 8:6,7 NKJV

--- Slide 18 ---
18
Saul’s first rejection
(After Saul didn’t wait for Samuel to come andoffer a burnt offering but offered it himself)
“You acted foolishly,” Samuel said. “You have not kept the command the LORD your God gave you; if you had, he would have established your kingdom over Israel for all time.  But now your kingdom will not endure; the LORD has sought out a man after his own heart and appointed him leader of his people, because you have not kept the LORD&#x27;s command.”
– 1 Samuel 13:13,14 NIV

--- Slide 19 ---
19
Saul’s second rejection
(After Saul didn’t totally destroy everything that belonged to the Amalekites, but rather feared the people and kept some for sacrifices)
But Samuel replied: “Does the LORD delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as much as in obeying the voice of the LORD ?  To obey is better than sacrifice, and to heed is better than the fat of rams.  For rebellion is like the sin of divination, and arrogance like the evil of idolatry.  Because you have rejected the word of the LORD, he has rejected you as king.”
– 1 Samuel 15:22,23 NIV

--- Slide 20 ---
20
Anointing of David
Man looks at the outward appearance, but the LORD looks at the heart.
– 1 Samuel 16:2 NIV

--- Slide 21 ---

David and Goliath
Moreover David said, “The LORD, who delivered me from the paw of the lion and from the paw of the bear, He will deliver me from the hand of this Philistine.”  And Saul said to David, “Go, and the LORD be with you!”.
– 1 Samuel 17:37 NKJV

--- Slide 22 ---
22
David and Goliath
Then David said to the Philistine, “You come to me with a sword, with a spear, and with a javelin. But I come to you in the name of the LORD of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied.  This day the LORD will deliver you into my hand, and I will strike you and take your head from you. And this day I will give the carcasses of the camp of the Philistines to the birds of the air and the wild beasts of the earth, that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel.”
– 1 Samuel 17:45,46 NKJV

--- Slide 23 ---

All those who were in distress or in debt or discontented gathered around him, and he became their leader. About four hundred men were with him.
– 1 Samuel 22:2 NIV

Davidic covenant
(Unconditional)
“When your days are over and you rest with your fathers, I will raise up your offspring to succeed you, who will come from your own body, and I will establish his kingdom.  He is the one who will build a house for my Name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever.”
– 2 Samuel 7:12,13 NIV

--- Slide 26 ---
26
David’s transgression
(Nathan rebukes David)
“Why did you despise the word of the LORD by doing what is evil in his eyes? You struck down Uriah the Hittite with the sword and took his wife to be your own. You killed him with the sword of the Ammonites.
– 2 Samuel 12:9 NIV

--- Slide 27 ---
27
David’s troubles
(Nathan rebukes David)
“Now, therefore, the sword will never depart from your house, because you despised me and took the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your own.”
– 2 Samuel 12:10 NIV

--- Slide 28 ---

David’s repentance
“Have mercy on me, O God, according to your unfailing love; according to your great compassion blot out my transgressions.  Wash away all my iniquity and cleanse me from my sin.  For I know my transgressions, and my sin is always before me.  Against you, you only, have I sinned and done what is evil in your sight, so that you are proved right when you speak and justified when you judge.  Surely I was sinful at birth, sinful from the time my mother conceived me.”
– Psalm 51:1-5 NIV
