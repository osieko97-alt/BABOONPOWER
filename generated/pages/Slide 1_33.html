Systems Development Life Cycle 
The Analysis Phase
Introduction to process modelling

--- Slide 2 ---
What is the System Development Cycle?
What is an information system (IS)?
Hardware, software, data, people, and procedures that work together to produce quality information
System—Set of components that interact to achieve common goal
Businesses use many types of systems

--- Slide 3 ---
What is the System Development Cycle?
What are the phases of the system development cycle?
Phase 1. Planning
Phase 2. Analysis
Phase 3. Design
Phase 4. Implementation
Phase 5. Support
Review project requests
Prioritize project requests
Allocate resources
Identify project development team
Conduct preliminary investigation
Perform detailed analysis activities:
Study current system
Determine user requirements
Recommend solution
Acquire hardware and software, if necessary
Develop details of system
Develop programs, if necessary
Install and test new system
Train users
Convert to new system
Conduct post-implementation system review
Identify errors and enhancements
Monitor system performance 

--- Slide 4 ---
Arrange tasks into phases (groups of activities)

What is the System Development Cycle?
What are guidelines for system development?
Involve users (anyone for whom system is being built)

Develop clearly defined standards (procedures company expects employees to follow)


--- Slide 5 ---
What is the System Development Cycle?
Who participates in the system development life cycle?

--- Slide 6 ---
What is the System Development Cycle?
What is a systems analyst?
Responsible for designing and developing information system
Liaison between users and IT professionals

--- Slide 7 ---
What is the System Development Cycle?
What is the project team?


Consists of users, systems analyst, and other IT professionals
Formed to work on project from beginning to end
Project leader—one member of the team who manages and controls project budget and schedule

--- Slide 8 ---
What is the System Development Cycle?
What is project management?
Process of planning, scheduling, and controlling activities during system development cycle
Project leader identifies elements for project
Required activities
Goal, objectives, and expectations, collectively called scope
Time estimates for each activity
Cost estimates for each activity
Activities that can take place at same time
Order of activities

--- Slide 9 ---
What is the System Development Cycle?
What is a Gantt chart?
Popular tool used to plan and schedule time relationships among project activities

--- Slide 10 ---
What is the System Development Cycle?
What is project management software?
Program (such as Microsoft Office Project 2003) used by project leaders to plan, schedule, and control projects

--- Slide 11 ---
What is the System Development Cycle?
What is feasibility?
Measure of how suitable system development will be to the company
Operational feasibility
Schedule feasibility
Four feasibility tests:
Technical feasibility
Economic feasibility (also called cost/benefit feasibility)

--- Slide 12 ---
What is the System Development Cycle?
What is documentation?


Includes reports, diagrams, programs, and other deliverables
Collection and summarization of data and information
Project notebook contains all documentation for single project

--- Slide 13 ---
What is the System Development Cycle?
What are six data and information gathering techniques?
Review documentation
Observe
Questionnaire
Interview
Joint-application design (JAD) session
Research

--- Slide 14 ---
What Initiates the System Development Cycle?
What are some reasons to create or modify an information system?
Competition can lead to change
To improve existing system
Outside group may mandate change
To correct problem in existing system

--- Slide 15 ---
What Initiates the System Development Cycle?
What is a request for system services?
Formal request for new or modified information system
Also called project request

--- Slide 16 ---
Planning Phase
What is the planning phase?
Begins when steering committee receives project request
Steering committee—decision-making body for the company
Function of committee:
Review and approve project requests
Allocate resources
Form project development team for each approved project
Prioritize project requests

--- Slide 17 ---
Analysis Phase
What is the analysis phase?

--- Slide 18 ---
Analysis Phase
What is the preliminary investigation?
Determine exact nature of problem or improvement and whether it is worth pursuing
Findings are presented in feasibility report, also known as a feasibility study

--- Slide 19 ---
Analysis Phase
What is detailed analysis?
Sometimes called logical design
2. Determine user’s wants, needs, and requirements
3. Recommend solution
1. Study how current system works

--- Slide 20 ---
Analysis Phase
What is process modeling?
Technique that describes processes that transform inputs into outputs
Also called structured analysis and design
Three tools used for process modeling
Entity-relationship diagrams
Data flow diagrams
Project dictionary

--- Slide 21 ---
Analysis Phase
What is an entity-relationship diagram (ERD)?
Tool that graphically shows connections between entities in system

--- Slide 22 ---
Analysis Phase
What is a data flow diagram (DFD)?
Tool that graphically shows flow of data in system

--- Slide 23 ---
Data dictionary
Decision trees
Decision tables
Structured English
Analysis Phase
What is a project dictionary?
Variety of techniques to enter items in project dictionary
Helps keep track of huge amount of details in system
Contains all the documentation and deliverables of project

--- Slide 24 ---
Analysis Phase
What is Structured English?
Used to explain details of process in project dictionary

--- Slide 25 ---
Analysis Phase
What is a decision table?
Lists variety of conditions and actions that correspond to each condition

--- Slide 26 ---
Analysis Phase
What is a decision tree?
Shows conditions and actions graphically

--- Slide 27 ---
Analysis Phase
What is a data dictionary?
Stores name, description, and other details about each data item

--- Slide 28 ---
Analysis Phase
What is object modeling?
Combines data with the processes that act on data into single unit called an object
Sometimes called object-oriented (OO) analysis and design
Uses Unified Modeling Language (UML)—graphical tool for documenting system
Object—an item that can contain both data and procedures that read or manipulate the data

--- Slide 29 ---
Analysis Phase
What is a use case diagram?
Graphically shows how actors interact with information system
Actor—user or other entity
Use case—function that actor can perform

--- Slide 30 ---
Analysis Phase
What is a class diagram?
Graphically shows classes and subclasses in system
Class is group of objects—Can have lower levels called subclasses

--- Slide 31 ---
Analysis Phase
What is the system proposal?




--- Slide 32 ---
Analysis Phase
What are possible software solutions?
Buy packaged software—prewritten software available for purchase
Outsource—have outside source develop software
Write own custom software—software developed at user’s request
Vertical market software—designed for particular industry
Horizontal market software—meets needs of many companies</pre>
