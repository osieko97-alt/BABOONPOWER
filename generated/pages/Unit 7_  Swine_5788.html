Unit 9:  Swine
Chapters 29 &amp; 30

--- Slide 2 ---
Objectives
Understanding of breed characteristics, traits, and measurements
Knowledge of performance data
Comprehension of genetic selection, and the use of crossbreeding
Awareness of various swine management systems, feeding, and the environment

--- Slide 3 ---
Characteristics of Swine Breeds
Generally grouped by:
Hair color
Dropping or erect ears
Popularity of breeds has changed with time &amp; technology
Hybrids becoming common
Hybridization began in the 1940’s
Selected by objective production measurements

--- Slide 12 ---
Traits &amp; their Measurements
Sow Productivity
Litter size
Number weaned/litter
21d litter weight
Litters/yr.
Traits are not highly heritable, so management must select for them, and manage through feeding and health
Crossbreeding can help improve productivity


--- Slide 13 ---

--- Slide 14 ---
Traits &amp; their Measurements
Growth
Growth Rate is 35% heritable
Can be effectively used in genetic selection
Measured by # of days to reach 260lbs.
Feed Efficiency
Lbs. of feed/lb. of gain
~30% heritable
Crucial b/c feed accounts for 60-70% of cost of production
How do we monitor feed efficiency?

--- Slide 17 ---
Traits &amp; their Measurements
Carcass Traits
Used to estimate lbs. or % acceptable quality lean pork (10% fat) in the carcass
~48% heritable
3 traits used to predict
Fat depth over loin at the tenth rib
Loin muscle area
Carcass muscling score
Can be predicted on live pigs by using ultrasound on backfat, or a well-trained eye

--- Slide 18 ---
Traits &amp; their Measurements
Structural Soundness
Capability of breeding and slaughter animals to withstand the rigors of confinement and breeding
Is somewhat heritable
Unsound pigs are generally culled
Inherited defects
Cryptorchidism
Retention of one or both testicles
Hernias
Umbilical
Scrotal

--- Slide 19 ---
Traits &amp; their Measurements
Inverted nipples
Pale, soft, exudative (PSE) carcasses
Porcine Stress Syndrome (PSS)
Due to extreme muscling
Results in death or PSE meat
Can be equal to non PSS pigs, but have a 30-50% risk of PSE


--- Slide 20 ---
Effective Use of Performance Records
Two influential factors
Genetics
Environment
4 features of sound genetic improvement program
Accurate, complete performance records &amp; animal ID
Assessment of genetic merit of important traits
Indexes relating traits to economic importance in commercial pork production
Selection of highest ranked boars &amp; gilts based on selection data
Rate of genetic improvement is parallel with the seedstock source

--- Slide 21 ---
Effective Use of Performance Records
Several genetic evaluation programs
STAGES (Swine Testing and Genetic Evaluation System)
Computes 21d litter weight, no. born alive
EPD’s are reported for backfat, loineye area, pounds of fat-free lean adjusted to 250lbs., days to 250lbs., feed/lb. of gain
SPI (Sow Productivity Index)-no. born alive, no. weaned, litter weight
Each unit SPI = $1/litter produced

--- Slide 22 ---
Effective Use of Performance Records
TSI (Terminal Sire Index)-useful in crossbreeding, only includes postweaning traits
Each unit = $1/10 pigs marketed
MLI (Maternal Line Index)-evaluates gilts for replacement
Uses both maternal &amp; terminal traits
Results expressed as EPD’s
EPD (Expected Progeny Difference)
Prediction of progeny performance compared to the average
Expressed as +/-
Average EPD set at 0

--- Slide 24 ---
Selecting Replacement Females
Foundation of commercial pork production
Select
Fast growing
Sound
Moderate lean
Good body capacity
From litters where 8-14 excellent pigs were weaned

--- Slide 25 ---
Selecting Replacement Females
Sows that farrow and will rebreed
Evaluate and cull:
Physical problems
Poor disposition
Small litters (2 pigs below herd ave.)
Poor mothering record
Must have enough gilts to replace culled sows
Suggested replacement rate is 20-25%
What happens is you are higher/lower?

--- Slide 28 ---
Boar Selection
Selected boars can contribute as much as 80-90% of herd genetic composition over time
Should have dams that are highly productive sows
Effectiveness determined by boar’s ability to pass on traits measured in replacement gilts

--- Slide 29 ---
Crossbreeding for Commercial Swine Production
Crossing two or more breeds increases chance of hybrid vigor
Most advances in growth rate &amp; leanness
&gt;90% of marketed hogs in commercial production are crossbred
Two types of crossbreeding
Rotational cross
Terminal cross

--- Slide 30 ---
Crossbreeding for Commercial Swine Production
Rotational Cross
Two + Breeds
Different breed boar is crossed with crossbred offspring of previous generation
Terminal Cross
Crossbred females are mated to a boar of a third breed
Rota-terminal
Combination of both systems
All pigs go to market
Female traits are not selected for

Types of Swine Operations
Feeder pig production
Breeding herd maintain
Feeder pigs for sale at avg. wt. 40#
Feeder pig finishing
Feeders fed to slaughter wt.
Farrow-to-finish
Purebred or Seedstock
Production is breeding boars and gilts

--- Slide 35 ---
Farrow-to-Finish
Major type swine production
Boar Mgmt.
Purchase at least 60d prior to breeding season for acclimation
Quarantine for 30d
30d fenceline exposure to develop immunity
Young boars 6-8# feed up to 260#
Servicing boars 3-6# feed
Test mate all boars
~1 in 12 are infertile

--- Slide 36 ---
Farrow-to-Finish
Young boars can pen-breed 8-10 gilts in 4 wks.
Mature boars 10-12
Hand mating can increase #bred/boar/wk.
Managing Breeding Females
Gilts start cycling ~5 mos.
Don’t breed first cycle
Breeding gilts should weigh 250-260# @ 8mos.
10h/pen is ideal
Temperature, herd health can negatively affect conception

--- Slide 37 ---

--- Slide 38 ---
Farrow-to-Finish
AI
~50% of all market hogs
Nutrition is key! Balance for needs without gaining wt.
4-5# of a balanced ration is usually sufficient during normal weather conditions
During Gestation pigs should be fed to gain 75-120#
Body condition should be 3-4 at birth time for optimal production

--- Slide 39 ---
Farrow-to-Finish
Sow Mgmt. during Farrowing &amp; Lactation
Ave. 10 pigs/litter 8 weaned
Well managed pigs will have 3-4 more/litter
Deworm before farrowing
Clean &amp; disinfect farrowing area
Leave unused for 5-7d
Clean sow (especially under belly)
Sow should be in a farrowing crate no later than d 110 of gestation
Ave. gestation 111-115d


--- Slide 40 ---
Figure 30.2     Sow and litter of pigs in a farrowing crate. The far- rowing crate is a pen (approximately 5  7 ft) that restricts the sow to a fixed area so that she does not lay on her babies. A panel several inches off the floor separates the sow from the baby pigs while allowing them access for nursing. Courtesy of the University of Illinois.

--- Slide 41 ---
Farrow-to-Finish
Sows nursing fewer than 8 pigs
3lbs. Feed for maintenance
1lb. Feed for each pig nursed
Sows &amp; gilts nursing more than 8 pigs
Free choice feed
Induced Farrowing
More common the last 10 yrs due to more efficient labor use, reduce pig mortality, heavier weaning wts, more cross-fostering
Induce on d 112 of gestation
Risks – stillbirths, abortions
Baby Pig Mgmt. from Birth – Weaning
Farrowing crates are designed to protect the baby pig
1/3 of baby pig deaths occurs within 72h of birth
Assistance in birthing is not needed unless there is obvious problems


--- Slide 42 ---
Farrow-to-Finish
Labor can last up to 5h w/ pigs being born ~15min apart
Pigs can be born either head or feet first
Preweaning Pig Mortality


--- Slide 43 ---
Farrow-to-Finish
Difficult births often associated with another problem:
Mastitis
Metritis
Agalactia
Baby pigs should get colostrum within 4-6h of birth
Immunoglobulin content decreases 50% within 6h
Air temperature is critical
Chill
Disease
Death
First 2 wks. are critical
