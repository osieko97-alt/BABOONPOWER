<pre>ALLITERATION
Alliteration
: is the repetition of consonant sounds in words that are close together.
Examples:
       The fair breeze blew, the white foam flew,
       The furrow followed free;
             We were the first that ever burst
       Into that silent sea.
   
The Rime of the Ancient Mariner

Sootty, swart smiths, smattered with smoke,
Drive me to death, with the din of their dents.
Such noice at night no man hear, never:
With knavish cries and clattering of knocks!

Where the quail is whistling
Betwixt the woods and the wheat-lot.
Walt Witman from

Full fathom five thy father lies.
