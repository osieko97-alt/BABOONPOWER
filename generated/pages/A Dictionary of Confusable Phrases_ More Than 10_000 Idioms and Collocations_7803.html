To really know English one has to master,
along with grammar and words, a reasonably
large vocabulary of recurrent collocations, id-ioms, and metaphorical expressions that reﬂectthe environment, history, and culture of the na-tive speakers and form an essential part of theircommon language, adding color, dimension andvibrancy to the way they speak and write. Fa-miliarity with idioms and colloquial metaphorsand ability to use them appropriately in contextare distinguishing markers of a native-like com-mand of English.
Learning a language is challenging enough
while learning set expressions (a language-within-a-language) becomes really frustrating attimes, not the least owing to the existence in En-glish of a very vast number of what we callphraseological “false friends and enemies”—id-iomatic and non-idiomatic expressions that, de-spite their outward similarity or contrast, haveunrelated meanings. Their confusion triggeredby false analogy may result in misunderstandingand miscommunication so knowing or notknowing the difference between phraseological“false friends” can mean the difference betweenunderstanding or not understanding English.
This dictionary has been speciﬁcally de-
signed to “diffuse” potentially confusable expres-sions. The dictionary pairs more than 10,000 id-
ioms and collocations characterized by similarityor contrast in their wording or metaphorical ideathat do not show corresponding similarity orcontrast in their meanings. Also included arecases when phraseological units form a semanticmismatch with consonant compound words.This contrastive format enables the languagelearner to see all potentially confusable units to-gether and so avoid confusing the phrase.
Most dictionary entries are made up of
phrases that are in active current use so infor-mation about the difference in their meaningsand usage is especially essential. Some entriesmay contain phrases pertaining to professionaljargon, slang, expressions that are dated or char-acteristic of one the principal regional varietiesof English. These, though less relevant in termsof their confusion, demonstrate interesting casesof coincidence in imagery through time andspace while their contribution to the dictionaryallows it to be also used as a regular explanatorydictionary providing deﬁnitions to individualidioms, clichés and set expressions.
There are numerous dictionaries of usage
covering the difference in the meaning, spellingand pronunciation of lexical “false friends”—ho-
mographs, homophones and semantically unre-lated words characterized by outward similarity.This comprehensive dictionary, however, repre-senting as it does an important cross-section ofthe language, is unique in that it is the ﬁrst at-tempt ever to provide a complete lexicographicinventory of phraseological pseudo-synonymsand -antonyms, both idiomatic and non-idio -matic.
Intended primarily for ESL students at dif-
ferent levels of proﬁciency, the dictionary can

also be used by authors of textbooks and other
educational materials who may screen the dic-tionary data for potentially confusable expres-sions incorporated in their products so as to cau-tion students against this kind of pitfall andheighten their awareness of phraseological sim-ilarities and differences. It can be recommendedfor use in school and college libraries supportingESL programs as well as to adults learning En-glish as a second language.Preface –2–

Even a cursory examination of English
phraseology reveals the existence of numerous
idiomatic expressions and recurrent word com-binations characterized by similarity of wordingor imagery without corresponding similarity intheir meaning or usage. Phraseological units ofthis kind usually form pairs and sometimeslarger groups of expressions not normally inter-changeable in their respective contexts or onlyinterchangeable in some of their meanings so er-rors can arise whenever one expression is sufﬁ-ciently close to another to be semantically iden-tiﬁed with it, cf.: bring one’s mind to something /bring something to mind or at the top of the tree /
up a tree. While positive intralingual transfer
may help in the case of perceived linguistic sim-ilarities, cf.: make hay while the sun shines / strike
while the iron is hot, negative intralingual transfer
will lead to problems owing to semantic orgram matical differences between units. Theprobability of their confusion is conditioned bythe extent of similarity while their respective lin-guistic currency determines which unit in thegroup is likely to be mistaken for another morefamiliar and seemingly identical expression.Alongside such phraseological “false friends”there exist less numerous cases of “false enemies”or pseudo-antonyms whose form may inducethe learner to believe that they are opposite inmeaning which in reality they are not,* cf.: ab-
sence of mind / presence of mind andcome on the
carpet / step off the carpet.
Whereas errors caused by interlingual
phraseological interference are predeterminedby the student’s ﬁrst language and mostly occurwhen learners pattern phrases in the target lan-guage after the models of their own language,errors caused by intralingual phraseological in-
terference are generally due to erroneous iden-tiﬁcation within the framework of the target lan-guage of semantically unrelated phraseologicalunits with conceptually related components. Er-rors of this kind do not depend on the learners’ﬁrst language and are common to all EFL/ESLstudents. They may adversely affect comprehen-sion and usage, so learners are in urgent needfor practical resource that will systematically ad-dress this problem and “defuse” potentially con-fusable multi-word units. Nonetheless, prior tothe present publication there was no dictionary
Introduction
FALSE “FRIENDS ” AND “ENEMIES ”
INENGLISH PHRASEOLOGY
–3–*The phenomenon of “false friends” is commonly associated with words of different languages relating as formal equivalents for the reason
of their material similarity while their meanings are quite different. A similar phenomenon can be observed at the phraseologic al level
when set expressions of one language have formal, semantically dissimilar equivalents in another language (for instance, the fo llowing
English expressions have their exact formal counterparts in Russian with altogether different meanings: dirty money, high words, service
ﬂat, special school, art ﬁlm, wind in the head ,etc.).

speciﬁcally devoted to phraseological pitfalls of
this kind even though some dictionaries of id-ioms would provide random cross-referenceswarning of idiomatic expressions whose formmay mislead the user into thinking that they aresemantically related. At the same time, thereexist numerous dictionaries of usage bringing tothe attention of the learner the difference in themeaning, spelling, pronunciation, and the rangeof application of individual words characterizedby outward similarity.* The present dictionary,providing systematic contrastive coverage of allkinds of phraseological “false friends” and “en-emies,” is expected therefore to remedy this im-balance and to ﬁll, at least partially, the existinglexicographical lacuna. Primarily intended forEFL/ESL students as a tool of reference and pro-phylactics, it presents a complete and orderlycatalog of multi-word units that require specialconsideration because of their interferential po-tential. Furthermore, the sizeable volume of thedictionary and its user-friendly Phrase Index en-able it to be used as a regular phraseological dic-tionary providing deﬁnitions to individual id-ioms, clichés and set expressions.
In the selection of phrases making up the
dictionary I proceeded from the broadest possi -ble concept of phraseology and considered bothidiomatic and non-idiomatic recurrent wordcombinations, prepositional collocations andphrasal verbs. No limits have been set with re-spect to their structural or pragmatic characteris -
tics, the principal criteria being similarity or con-trast in the wording or imagery of multi-wordunits whose meanings or usage do not show cor-responding similarity or contrast. Potentially in-terferential units were culled from the phraseo-logical pool provided by over a hundred mono-and bilingual dictionaries as well as numerousonline databases. Contrastive-differentiatinganalysis of the totality of phraseological unitsthus selected made it possible to separate groupsof semantically and pragmatically similar phrase-ological synonyms and variants (cf.: add fuel tothe ﬁre / add fuel to the ﬂames ) from inter  fer -
